The son of the king of the inhabited world, the resplendent one, the beloved of Mami, let me sing of the mighty one, the son of Enlil.
Ninurta, the resplendent one, the beloved of Mami - let me praise the mighty one, the god, the son of Enlil, the offspring of the Ekur, the pre-eminent one of the Anunnaku, the trusted one of the Eninnu, the irrigator of pens, cultivated land, city, street and city, the wave of battle, the wave of battle, the whirling one, the sash of heroism.
Furious tireless demons are fearful of his attack.
Hear the praise of the strength of the mighty one, of the one who by his ferocity bound and fettered the things of stone, the one who conquered flying Anzu with his weapon, the one who killed the Kusarikku in the centre of the sea; powerful, valiant, roaring with his weapon, the strong one, the one who hastens, the servant in battle and combat
Hitherto, cult daises had not been created among the Igigi; the Igigi were thus gathered together in their supreme divine power
The rivers Tigris and Euphrates were created, but the sources were not bringing their waters to the land.
With all the Igigi gathered before Enlil, their father, the hero of the gods, his sons brought news.
" Heed the propitious utterance".
The father of the gods, Duranki saw him and took their utterance to heart.
Ea answered with a heart-felt speech.
Niššiku said to Enlil:
" The wide earth conceived him. He is the one born in the rocks of the mountain.
May he stand before you and may he not leave you.
May he always block the seat of the shrine in the cella.
The god answered " Yes" to the word he said to him.
He took shrines ... and assigned the commissions of all the gods.
He would repeat the fate and Anzu would hold it.
Enlil entrusted the entrance of the shrine that he had completed to him.
He would bathe in the pure waters before him
He would observe the deeds of divine supremacy with his own eyes.
Anzu would gaze on his lordly tiara, his divine cloak, and on the tablet of destinies in his hands.
He would look upon the father of the gods, Duranki and decided to steal divine supremacy.
Anzu would look upon the father of the gods, Duranki and decided to steal divine supremacy.
" I myself will take the tablet of destinies of the gods, and so gather up the commissions of all the gods, control the throne, extinguish the divine powers and assign all of the Igigi."
In his heart, he plotted an assault as he awaited the day at the entrance to the shrine where he would gaze.
When Enlil was bathing in the pure waters, stripped, with his tiara placed on the throne, he took control of the tablet of destinies with his hands.
He took divine supremacy. The divine powers were overthrown.
Anzu flew away and went off to his mountain.
A deathly hush poured out and silence settled.
Ellil, their father and adviser was deathly still.
The shrine was stripped of its awe-inspiring radiance.
The gods of the land convened for direction.
Anu opened his mouth to speak, saying to the gods his sons: " Which god will kill Anzu and magnify his name throughout the whole of the inhabited world?"
They called Gugallu, the son of Anum.
Plan settled, they spoke to him.
They called Adad, the canal inspector, the son of Anum.
Plan settled, they spoke to him thus: " O Adad, mighty one, O Adad, martial one, may your battle not turn back. Strike like lightning at Anzu with your weapons. May your name become great in the assembly of the great gods. May you have no rival among the gods, your brothers."
" Let there be daises built."
" Set up your shrines in the four world regions."
" Let your shrines enter the Ekur."
" Make your name splendid before the gods as the mighty one."
Adad answered the command.
He was saying these words to Anu his father:
" My father, who would hasten to an unapproachable mountain?"
" Which among the gods your children is the conqueror of Anzu?"
" He took control of the tablet of destinies into his hands. He took divine supremacy. The divine powers are overthrown. Anzu flew away and went off to his mountain."
The utterance of his mouth has become like that of the god, Duranki.
He pronounces and the one that he curses turns to clay
The gods became despondent at the utterance of his mouth.
He turned away. He refused to go.
They called Gibil, the son of Annunitu. Plan settled, they spoke to him thus: " O Gibil, mighty one, O Gibil, martial one, may your battle not turn back. Strike like lightning at Anzu with your weapons. May your name become great in the assembly of the great gods. May you have no rival among the gods, your brothers.
Let there be daises built.
Set up your shrines in the four world regions.
Let your shrines enter the Ekur.
Make your name splendid before the gods, may your name be Mighty One.
Gibil answered the command.
He was saying these words to Anu his father:
" My father, who would hasten to an unapproachable mountain?"
" Which among the gods your children is the conqueror of Anzu?"
" He took control of the tablet of destinies into his hands. He took divine supremacy. The divine powers were overthrown. Anzu flew away and went off to his mountain."
The utterance of his mouth has become like that of the god, Duranki.
He pronounces and the one that he curses turns to clay
The gods became despondent at the utterance of his mouth.
He turned away. He refused to go.
They called Šara, the son of Ištar. Plan settled, they spoke to him thus: " O Šara, mighty one, O Šara, martial one, may your battle not turn back. Strike like lightning at Anzu with your weapons. May your name become great in the assembly of the great gods. May you have no rival among the gods, your brothers."
Let there be daises built.
Set up your shrines in the four world regions.
Let your shrines enter the Ekur.
Make your name splendid before the gods as the mighty one.
Šara answered the command.
He was saying these words to Anu his father:
My father, who would hasten to an unapproachable mountain?
Which among the gods your children is the conqueror of Anzu?
" He took control of the tablet of destinies into his hands. He took divine supremacy. The divine powers were overthrown. Anzu flew away and went off to his mountain."
" The utterance of his mouth has become like that of the god, Duranki."
" He pronounces and the one that he curses turns to clay."
The gods became despondent at the utterance of his mouth.
He turned away. He refused to go.
They became spent, the gods abandoned counsel.
The Igigi became extremely despondent where they were sat.
The lord of wisdom. the inhabitant of the Apsu, the expert, was devising an idea in the wisdom of his heart.
Ea had devised wisdom in his heart.
He was saying to Anu all that he had spoken about in his heart.
" Let me make a pronouncement in order to find a god and let me identify the conqueror of Anzu in the assembly"
" Let it be me who finds the god and identifies the conqueror of Anzu in the assembly."
The Igigi heared this speach of his and they trembled, the Igigi kissed his feet.
Niššiku opened his mouth to speak, he was saying to Anu and Dagan:
" Let them summon to me Belet-Ili, the sister of the gods, the expert, the adviser of the gods her brothers."
" Let them proclaim her greatness in the assembly."
" Let the gods honour her in their assembly."
" Let me say to her the idea that is in my heart."
They summoned Belet-Ili, the sister of the gods, the expert, the adviser of the gods her brothers.
They proclaimed her greatness in the assembly.
The gods honoured her in their assembly.
Ea expressed the idea from the wisdom of his heart.
" Formerly, we called you Mami; now may your name be ' Lady of All the Gods'."
" Give us the mighty one, the resplendent one, your beloved, the wide of chest, the servent in battle and combat."
" Give us Ninurta, the resplendent one, your beloved, the wide of chest, the servent in battle and combat."
" May he magnify his name in all of the inhabited world."
She heard this speech and the formidable one, Belet-Ili gave her assent.
The Igigi rejoiced at her utterance.
They trembled and kissed her feet.
She called her son in the assembly of the gods and she commissioned him, the beloved of her heart, saying to him:
" They spoke of the ways of office in the assembly
" I gave birth to all of the Igigi."
" I created every single one of them and I created the great assembly of the Anunnaku.
" I assigned the kingship of heaven to Anum."
Anzu has confused the kingship that I assigned."
" He has robbed Ellil, he has spurned your father."
" He has taken away divine powers, he has taken them in his hand."
" Blitz the way and set the time."
" Blitz the way and set the time"
" Send out light for the gods whom I made."
" Raise your entire battle force."
" Strike and let your destructive wind go upon him."
" Conquer flying Anzu."
" Devastate the earth where he was created, wreck his dwelling."
" Let the battle-array resound against him."
" Let your ferocious battle force rage on against him."
" Let the entirity of it make the dust storm block him."
" Draw the bow. Let the arrow become poison to him."
" Let your features become changed like a gallu-demon."
" Send out fog, so that he may not distinguish your face."
" Let your radiance go against him."
" Let your attack be glorious, may you have radiance."
" Let the sun not shine on him."
" Let the bright day turn to darkness for him."
" Destroy his life and conquer Anzu."
" Let the wind carry his feathers as good news to the temple Ekur for your father, Ellil."
" Devastate and trouble the environs of the mountains."
" Cut down the life of wicked Anzu."
" Let kingship enter the Ekur."
" Let divine powers return to the father your begetter."
" Let there be daises built."
" Set up your shrines in the four world regions."
" Let your shrines enter the Ekur."
" Make yourelf splendid before the gods, may your name be Mighty One."
The hero heard the utterance of his mother.
He writhed, he became furious and he went off to his mountain.
My lord seized the seven battles.
The hero seized the seven destructive winds, the stirrer-up of dust, the seven dust storms
He launched a ferocious war, he initiated battle.
The gale attended at his side for battle.
Anzu and Ninurta met on the side of the mountain.
Anzu saw him and became furious with him.
He ground his teeth like a storm demon and he covered the mountain with his fearsome radiance.
Possessed of anger, he roared like a lion.
In the rage of his heart, he called out to the hero.
" I have taken away all of the divine powers, and I assign the commissions of all the gods.
" Who are you who have come to battle with me? Give your reason."
(Thus) he advanced aggressively against him and sent out his utterance to him.
The hero Ninurta answered Anzu: " I am Ninurta, the support of Duranki, the confirmer of the wide earth, and of Ea, the king of destinies. I come to ... , I trample you.
Anzu heard his utterance and let loose his furious clamour from in the centre of the mountain.
Darkness was established and the face of the mountain was covered as the sun, the light of the gods grew dark.
He roared the attack, the sign of Anzu was his clamour.
In between battle and conflict, warfare drew close, the flood was swollen, battle-array was aroused and bathed in blood.
A cloud of death rained down, arrows flashed like lightening.
Battle rushed in between them and roared.
The mighty one, the resplendent one, the son of Mami, the support of Anum and Dagan, the loved one of Niššiku drew the bow and nocked an arrow.
From the handhold of the bow, he launched an arrow.
The arrow did not approach Anzu, but returned.
Anzu called out to it: " Arrow that has come, return to your reed-bed; frame of the bow, return to your forest; bow-string to the ram's tendon, arrow flight to the bird."
Carrying the tablet of destinies of the gods in his hand, the bow-string and the bow launched an arrow, but it did not approach his body.
The battle became deathly still and battle was held back.
The clash of weapons ceased in the midst of the mountain, Anzu was not conquered.
He called Šarur and issued a command to him: " repeat the deeds that you saw to Ea and Niššiku."
" Lord Ninurta was surrounding Anzu, Ninurta was surrounded by the dust of battle, the hero was surrounded by the dust of devastation."
" He drew the bow and nocked an arrow."
He drew the bow, he launched an arrow.
The arrow did not approach Anzu, but returned.
Anzu called out to it: " Arrow that has come, return to your reed-bed; frame of the bow, return to your forest; bow-string to the ram's tendon, arrow flight to the birds."
" Carrying the tablet of destinies of the gods in his hand, the bow-string of the bow launched an arrow, but it did not approach his body."
" The battle became deathly still and battle was held back."
" The clash of weapons ceased in the midst of the mountain, Anzu was not conquered."
Šarur prostrated himself and received the command.
He took the message of the battle to Ea Niššiku.
All that the lord had said to him, he repeated to Ea, saying " O Lord, Ninurta was surrounding Anzu, Ninurta was surrounded by the dust of devastation."
" He drew the bow, he launched an arrow."
" The arrow did not approach Anzu, but returned."
" Anzu called out to it: " Arrow that has come, return to your reed-bed; frame of the bow, fall to your forest; bow-string to the ram's tendon, arrow flight return to the bird."
" Carrying the tablet of destinies of the gods in his hand, the bow-string and the bow launched an arrow, but it did not approach his body."
" The battle became deathly still and battle was held back."
The clash of weapons ceased in the midst of the mountain, Anzu was not conquered.
Niššiku heard the word of his son, called Šarur and issued a command to him:
" Repeat to your lord the word of the utterance of my mouth, and heed all that I say for him.
" Do not rest in battle and so bring about victory."
" Tire him out so that he may let fall his wing tip in the opposing of the storm wind."
" O Lord, take hold of your arrows towards the rear."
" Cut off his wing tips and strike them off left and right."
" Let him look at his wings so that they take away the utterance of his mouth."
" He will call out " wings" to the wings; you must fear him still."
" Draw from the handhold of your bow, let the arrow go like lightning."
" Let wing tip and wing play like butterflies."
" Destroy his life, conquer Anzu and let the wind carry his feathers as a message to the temple Ekur for your father, Ellil."
" Devastate and trouble the environs of the mountains."
" Cut down the life of wicked Anzu."
" Let kingship re-enter the Ekur."

" Let there be daises to be built."
" Set up your shrines in the four world regions."
" Let your shrines enter the Ekur."

Šarur prostrated himself and took the instruction.
He took the message of battle off to his lord.
He repeated all that Ea had said for him.
" Do not rest in battle and so bring about victory."
" Tire him out so that he may let fall his wing tip in the opposing of the storm wind."
" O Lord, take hold of your arrows towards the rear."
" Cut off his wing tips and strike them off left and right."
" Let him look at his wings so that they take away the utterance of his mouth."
" He will call out " wings" to the wings; you must fear him still."

' We who ... and went up the mountain, seized the Bull of Heaven ...,

' what sleep seized you? You, come back to me and ... not ....
' But he (Enkidu), he is not lifting his head; I am feeling his heart but ...

' I am circling over him. Like a lion whose cubs (are) in pits, ...
' in front of him and behind him. I am tearing out (and) discarding (my) curly
' hair.' He was tearing off (and) throwing away (his) finery, like something taboo ....
... Gilgameš sent out a call to the land: ' Smith! ... worker!
' Coppersmith! Goldsmith! Jeweller! Make my friend ...!'
... he fashioned a statue of his friend: ' The limbs of my friend ...;

' May he alter my name and put his name.' : He tore out ... ... he threw down.
He was listening carefully to his words, quickly, early his tears were flowing.
Gilgameš was listening carefully to the words of Enkidu, his friend, ... his tears were flowing.
Gilgameš opened his mouth to speak, saying to Enkidu: '... ... manifest,
'... possesses wisdom, good judgement, ... ... ... hostilities?
' Why, my friend, did your heart utter ...?
'... was precious and the fear was much. ... like flies,

"... he commanded he did not erase again,
"... he made known he did not erase again." : My friend, ... ... is drawn,
' people do go to their fate before their time.' : At the first glimmer of dawn,
Enkidu raised his head, lamenting before Šamaš,
his tears flowing before the light of Šamaš:
' I appeal to you, ..., for the sake of my most precious life!
'... the trapper man, : who did not let me be a match ...,
' Destroy ...!

'... brightening.
'... the going out of the livestock,
'... you came out for the land.
'..., the heavens become bright,

(may Aya say to Šamaš:) " while Gilgameš goes to the forest of cedar,
" may the days be very long, may the nights be short,
" may his loins be girt, may his legs be in motion.
" At night may he pitch a camp for an overnight stay,
" an overnight stay ... they will lie down."
' May she not be afraid of you, may Aya, the great bride, remind you.
' On the day that Gilgameš, Enkidu, and Humbaba meet with one another,
' raise the great storm winds against him, O Šamaš, against Humbaba:
' south wind, north wind, east wind, west wind, blast, counterblast,
' gale, destructive wind, typhoon, demon wind,
' icy blast, storm wind, dust storm.
' May the 13 winds arise and Humbaba's face darken
' and the weapons of Gilgameš conquer Humbaba.
' After your own ... has been lit,

' May your swift mules ... ... you,
' may a relaxing seat, a (gloss: break) bed, be set out for you.
' May the gods, your brothers, give you the food offerings that you ...,
' may Aya, the great bride, wipe your face with her clean garment-fringe.'
Rimat-Ninsun repeated (her) behest again before Šamaš:
' O Šamaš, will Gilgameš not ... the gods?
' Will he not share the heavens with you?
' Will he not share a sceptre with ...?
' Will he not become wise with ... of the Apsu?
' Will he not rule the people, the black-headed ones, with Irnini?

They put bread in front of him,

The 4 ... grew large
and the eyes, like that, ....
He was very tall among the gods, ...,
the limbs were long, ... in birth.
The Son-Utu, the Son-Utu : the son, the sun god, the sun god of the gods!
He was wearing the auras of ten gods, he was crowned on high,
fifty terrors were heaped upon him.
Anu created and produced the 4 winds,
he put (them) in his hand: ' My son, let them play.'
He (Marduk) created dust, he made the storm wind carry (it),
he brought a wave into existence, so that it disturbed Tiamat.
Tiamat, disturbed, was moving about day and night,
the gods, not relaxed, were being carried by every wind.
They plotted evil in their hearts,
they said to Tiamat, their mother:
' When they killed Apsu, your lover,
' you did not go at his side, you sat in silence.
' He (Anu) created the four winds of terror,
' your heart being disturbed, we cannot sleep.
' Apsu, your lover, did not exist in your heart
' and as for Mummu who was bound, you were sitting (apart) alone.
'... today you will move about in confusion,
'... us (who) cannot lie down to rest, ....'
... her (Tiamat's) offspring.
... Apsu ... she did evil,
... to Ea ... she had prepared ....
Ea ... that declaration,
he grew still ... in silence.
... he had reflected and his anger had calmed,
he advanced ... Anšar, his father.
He entered before the father, his parent, Anšar,
he repeated to him ... Tiamat plotted:
'..., Tiamat, our parent, hates us,
' she is provided with an assembly, she is furiously angry.
' All the gods turned to her,
'... those whom you created, going at her side.
' They grouped together, standing at Tiamat's side,
' furious, plotting, not resting night and day.
' They are waging war, enraged, angry,
' they are provided with an assembly, so that they can create conflict : Mother Hubur, creator of everything,
' added irresistible weapons, gave birth to monster snakes.
' They had pointed teeth, they were merciless in ... : she filled their bodies with venom instead of blood.
' She clothed ... great dragons with terrors,
'..., she made (them) like a god:
"..., let ... rear up, so that they shall not turn back."
'... Hairy Heroes,'
(Marduk saying to Anšar:) ' Collectively in Ubšukkinnakku ... joyfully,
' by opening my mouth let me determine destinies instead of you.
' All that I create shall not be changed,
' let the pronouncement of my lips not be retracted, let it not be altered.'
After it (the next tablet begins): Anšar opened his mouth.
Written and checked according to its original. Hand of Iddi-Meslamtaea, ...
... ... may he take him away. He who ...
... ... ...
... of rulership,
... he (Marduk) took up residence ... sovereignty.
(The gods said to Marduk:) '... the great gods,
'..., your speech is Anu.
'... among the great gods,
'... is ... rivalled, your speech is Anu.
'... your command may not be changed,
' raising high and bringing low, may that be your power.
'... the utterance of your mouth be steadfast, may your speech be unrivalled,
'... among the gods may cross your boundary.
' Provisioning ... the sanctuary of the gods,
'... their cellas are, may your place ....
' O Marduk, you are our avenger,
' may we give you kingship over ... all totality.
' Sit down in the assembly, may your word be elevated,
' May your weapons not miss, may they crush your enemies.
' O lord, as for ..., spare his life,
and as for the gods ..., pour out their life!'
They set up a single constellation between them,
they said to Marduk, their son:
' May your destiny, o lord, be equal to the gods,
' command destruction or creation, so that it can be realised.
' At the opening of ..., may the constellation be destroyed,
' command it again, so that the constellation can become intact.'
He commanded and at his utterance the constellation was destroyed,
He commanded it again and the constellation was created.
When the gods his fathers saw (the effect of) the utterance of his mouth,
they became joyful, they hailed: ' Marduk is king'.
They added for him a sceptre, throne, and palû-symbol of kingship,
they gave him a weapon that cannot be faced, one that repels enemies, (saying):
' Go and slit the throat of Tiamat,
' may the winds bring her blood for news.'
The gods his fathers determined the destiny of the lord,
they set him off on the way of well-being and obedience.
He fashioned the bow, he appointed it his weapon,
he nocked the arrow, he fixed the bowstring for it.
He raised the miṭṭu-weapon, he made his right hand grasp it,
he hung the bow and the quiver at his side.
He put lightning in front of him,
he filled his body with blazing flame.
He made a net to encircle the innards of Tiamat,
he mustered the four winds so that none of her might escape.
South wind, north wind, east wind, west wind,
the gift of his father Anu, at his side, he put near the net.
... the destructive wind, the evil wind, the storm wind, the dust storm,
the 4 ..., the 7 winds, the whirlwind, the irresistible wind.
He sent out the winds that he had created, the seven of them,
to disturb the innards of Tiamat, they had arisen behind him.
The lord raised the flood, his great weapon,
he rode ... of the storm, that cannot be faced, terrible.
He hitched to it the team of four, he harnessed them at its side:
' Murderer', ' Merciless One', ' Destroyer', ' Flyer'.
Their lips were open, their teeth bore poison,
they did not know getting tired, they knew overwhelming.
He set up on his right terrifying battle and combat,
on the left war that repels all allies.
He was clad in a garment of a battle-array of terrors,
he was wearing on his head an aura of terrifying appearance.
The lord started out, he advanced on his way,
he set his face towards Tiamat who was furious.
He was holding an incantation on his lips,
while gripping in his hand a plant, an antidote to poison.
At that time the gods were running round him, they were running round him,
the gods his fathers were running round him, the gods were running round him.
The lord approached, to look at the battle of Tiamat,
to look for the plan of Qingu her consort.
As he looked, his advance was confused,
his reason was scattered, his actions were disordered.
And the gods his helpers, the ones who went at his side,
saw the foremost hero, he confused their sight.
... she cast her incantation, while ... turning her neck,
while holding on her lips falsehood, lies:
'... ... ... the lord, the gods are risen up against him,
' in their place ... in his place?'
The lord raised ... his great weapon,
to Tiamat who became angry thus he sent word:
' Why are you haughty (and) lifted up on high,
' and (why) is your heart plotting raising war?
' The sons shouted, treating their fathers with disrespect,
' but you, their parent, spurned compassion.
' You nominated Qingu to your consortship,
' inappropriately for him, you appointed him to the office of lordship.
' Against Anšar king of the gods you sought evil deeds,
' and against the gods his fathers you established your evil.
' May your main force be equipped, may those your weapons be attached,
' Make contact, so that you and I can have a single combat.'
When Tiamat heard this,
she became like a female ecstatic, she deranged her reason.
Tiamat shouted wildly against him,
to the roots as one her foundations shook.
She was reciting the spell, she was keeping on casting her incantation,
and the gods of battle were sharpening those their weapons.
Tiamat and the sage of the gods, Marduk, came together,
they were interlocked in combat, they were at close quarters in battle.
The lord spread out his net (and) encircled her,
he released in her face the destructive wind, the one occupying the rear.
Tiamat opened her mouth to swallow,
he made the destructive wind go in so that she could not close her lips.
The violent winds bloated her stomach,
her insides were paralysed, she opened her mouth wide.
He shot an arrow, he broke open her stomach,
he cut through her innards, he split (her) insides.
He defeated her and extinguished her life,
he threw down her corpse, he stood on it.
After he had killed Tiamat the leader,
he dispersed her troops, he scattered ....
And the gods, her helpers, the ones who went at her side,
began to tremble, they became afraid, they turned their course.
They escaped, so that they could save their lives,
... ..., so that they could ... flee.
He confined them, he smashed their weapons,
Thrown into the net, they sat down in the hunting trap.
... the corners, they were full of moaning,
they were bearing her punishment, they were held in captivity.
... her eleven creatures, who were adorned with terrors,
... demons, the ones who went as grooms on her right,
... nose-ropes, he bound their arms,
... their battle he trampled beneath him.
... Qingu, who had kept becoming greater among them,
he (Marduk) defeated him and counted him with the Dead Gods.
He took away from him ... of destinies inappropriately his,
he sealed ... and attached (it) on his chest.
... he had defeated (and) smote ...,
he had silenced ... ...,
he had established totally ... over the enemies,
... the hero had achieved ... of Nudimmud,
... his captivity ... bound ...,
... Tiamat whom he had defeated.
The lord ... Tiamat's ...,
... merciless ... he shattered the skull.
He slit the veins of her blood,
he made ... the north wind carry (it) for news.
His fathers ..., they became joyful, they rejoiced,
they had delivered ..., a greeting-gift, they to him.
The lord rested, looking at her corpse,
intending to divide ... to create artful things.
Like a dried fish he broke her open into her two parts,
He set up half of her and made the sky into a roof.
He stretched the skin, he posted a guard,
he ordered them not to let ... escape.
He crossed ..., he examined the firmament,
... equal to the Apsu, dwelling of Nudimmud.
The lord ... the form of the Apsu,
he established Ešara as the likeness of ....
... Ešara that he created, the sky,
he made ... Ea occupy their shrines.

And the gods, her helpers, the ones who went at her side,

They tried to escape to save their (lit. his) lives,
(but) were surrounded (and) could not flee.
He confined them, he smashed their weapons,
Thrown into the net, they sat down in the hunting trap.
They were taking refuge in the corners, they were full of moaning,

The lord rested, looking at her corpse,
intending to divide ... to create artful things.
... dried ... into her two parts,

..., he posted ...,
... ... ...
... mankind, he imposed the gods' work (on them) and set the gods free.
... the wise Ea ... (and) imposed the work of the gods on them,
... not suitable for understanding
... of Marduk, Nudimmud created.
... divided the gods,
..., all of them, above and below.
... to Anu the guarding of his instructions,
... he installed as watch.
... he planned the ways of the Underworld.
In heaven and the Underworld, he settled 600 (gods).
After he had given all of them (their) instructions
(and) divided their shares to the Anunnaku of heaven and Underworld,
the Anunnaku opened their mouths
to speak to Marduk, their lord:
" Now, lord, who brought about our freedom,
" what good things can we do for you?
" Let us build a cult dais whose name is called.
" Your cella shall be our stopping place; we shall rest therein.
" We shall lay out the cult dais (and) install its emplacement. On the date that we achieve (this), we shall rest therein."
When Marduk heard this, his appearance brightened greatly, like the day, (and he said):
" Build Babylon and (do) the work that you request! May its brickwork be moulded and build the cult dais high!"
The Anunaku wielded the hoe. The first year they made bricks.
When the second year arrived, they raised the upper part of Esaggil, a copy of the Apsu,
and built the upper ziggurat of the Apsu.
For the gods ... and Anu, they established his ... as dwelling.
In majesty he sat before them and its (Esaggil's) horns faced the foundations of Ešara.
After they had done the work of the Esaggil, all the Anunnaku created their own cult daises.
The 300 (lit. 5 sixties) Igigi of the heavens (and) the 600 of the Apsu all gathered.
The lord, on the exalted dais which they had created as his dwelling,
seated the gods, his fathers, at his banquet (saying): " This is Babylon, the seat of your love.
" Sing joyfully at this place so that they shall speak of its joy!"
The great gods sat down.
They put down zarbābu-vessels (and) sat down at the banquet.
After they had performed a joyful nigûtu-song inside it (Esaggil),
they performed the taqribtu-ritual in the awe-inspiring Esaggil.
All the instructions and plans were established.
All the gods divided the positions of heaven and Underworld.
The great gods, fifthy of them, sat down and
the seven gods of destinies were established firmly to (give) decisions.
The lord presented the bow, his weapon, and laid it down before them.
The gods, his fathers, examined the net which he had made,
they saw how skilful the bow's appearance was
(and) praised the deeds which he had done, his fathers.
Anu raised it (the bow) in the assembly of the gods and said
and kissed the bow: " May this be my daughter!"
He named the names of the bow thus:
' Longwood' shall be the first, the second shall be ...
its third name, ' Bow-star', he revealed in heaven.
He established its station with the gods, its companions.
After Anu had determined the destinies of the bow,
he erected the throne of kingship which was the highest among the gods.
Anu placed it in the assembly of the gods.
The great gods assembled, they raised Marduk's destiny above their own (and) prostrated themselves.
They spoke a curse to themselves,
with water and oil they swore (and) grasped (their) throats.
They gave him the exercise of kingship over the gods,
they established him firmly for the lordship of the gods of heaven and Underworld.
Anšar gave him his additional name Asalluhi (saying):
" At the mention of his name, we shall show submission,
" (at) his utterances, the gods shall pay attention,
" his speech shall be supreme above and below.
" The son, our avenger, shall be very exalted.
" His lordship shall be supreme, he shall have no rival.
" He shall perform the shepherdship of the black-headed people, his creations.
" so that they may speak of his ways for posterity, without forgetting.
" He shall establish great food offerings for his fathers,
" He shall exercise the role of provisioner for them (and) care for their chapels.
" He shall have (them) smell the incense offering (and) rejoice at their sustenance.
" He shall do on earth the equivalent of what he did in heaven.
" He shall appoint the black-headed people to revere him.
" May the people be mindful (and) invoke their gods.
" At his command, may they pay attention to their goddesses,
" (and) may food offerings be brought to their gods and goddesses.
" Let it not be forgotten (and) care for their gods. They shall make their sacred precincts glorious (and) build their daises.
" The black-headed people may be divided (as to) gods,
" to us, whatever name we call (him), he shall be our god.
" Let us pronounce his fifty names,
" that his ways be made transparent, his deeds equal.
" MARDUK whom his father Anu named from his birth
" provider of pasture and watering places, the one who enriches every stable,
" who, with his weapon, the flood, bound the enemies
" (and) spared the gods, his fathers, from hardship.
" He shall be the son, the sun god of the gods, the shining one,
" so that they may always wander in his bright light.
" On the people whom he created, the living creatures,

a deep heart that the gods in their totality do not understand.
ADDU shall be his name, he shall cover the whole of heaven,
... shall rumble loudly over the earth,

... ...
... he made (them) billow.
..., to cause the rain to fall,

... to himself (and) he took (it) in his hand. He put down her head (and) heaped a mountain upon it.
He opened ... so that it was soaked (with) water. From her eyes he let the Euphrates (and) the Tigris flow;
he closed up ... but spared .... On her nipples he heaped up the high mountains
(and) drilled ... to carry off (water) to the cisterns.

... that their organisation be greatly established. After he had designed his cultic rites (and) established his cultic regulations,
he put on nose-ropes (and) entrusted (them) to Ea.
He appropriated the tablet of destinies which Qingu had taken away and
took (it) away as a ... gift (and) gave it to Anu.
The net of battle which hung at his side
... ... he brought before his forefathers.
... her eleven creatures that Tiamat created ...,
he broke their weapons (and) confined them at his feet; he created images of them ... and installed (them) at ... of the Apsu (saying):
" May it be a sign so that it will never be forgotten." The ... saw it and their hearts rejoiced joyfully.
Lahmu and Lahamu (and) his forefathers, all of them;
Anšar embraced him and proclaimed him " king" as a greeting,
Anu, Ellil and Ea bestowed gifts on him,
and Damkina, his mother, celebrated him
(and) made his face radiant with a beautiful ....
To Usmu, who brought her (Damkina's) gift at the news,
he entrusted the ministry of the Apsu (and) the care of the shrines.
The Igigi were assembled and they all prostrated themselves before him.
The Anunnaku, as many as there are, kissed his feet.
They all came together to show submission to him,
they stood before him (and) bowed down (saying): " There is the king!"
His fathers ... (and) were satisfied.
... ..., surrounded with the dust of combat,

"... Marduk was our beloved son,
"... your king, heed his command!"
... they spoke, saying all together:
" His name is Lugaldimerankia (' King, god of heaven (and) earth'); trust him!"
When they gave the kingship to Marduk
they spoke to him a wish of goodness and attention:
" From today, you shall be the provisioner of our cult daises!
" Whatever you say, we will do it!"
Marduk opened his mouth to speak,
a word is spoken to the gods, his forefathers:
" Above the Apsu, the dwelling you established,
" opposite Ešara, that I created for you,
" below the firmament, whose ground I made firm,
" I will build a house - may it be the dwelling of my desires.
" Therein I will found its shrine,

" When you go up from the Apsu to the assembly, may it be the place of your evening rest before the assembly.
" When you descend from the heavens to the assembly, may it be the place of your evening rest before the assembly.
" I will name its name ... great ....

He (Išum) spoke to his weapons: " Anoint yourselves ...!"
To the Seven, unrivalled heroes, (he said): " Put on ...!"
And he said to you (Erra): " I wish to go out ... # or to you (Išum): as, e.g., Cooley; however, cf. l. o i 13
" You are the torch, and they will see ...,

" How bright (your) mood (will be), how joyful your heart!" # l.15-18: narrator about Erra
Erra, whose arms ... like those of a sleepless man,
said to his heart: " Should I stand up (or) lie down?"
And he said to his weapons: " Hide in the corners!"
(And) to the Seven, unrivalled heroes: " Return to your dwellings!" # l.19-22: narrator addressing Išum
Until you (Išum) wake him up, he will be asleep in his bedroom,
enjoying himself with Mami, his wife.
He is Engidudu, " the lord who roams at night," " the guide of the nobles,"
who always leads a boy and a girl into safety, making (them) shine like the day. # narrator about the history of the Seven
The divinity of the Seven, unrivalled heroes, is very different:
their origin is strange and they are full of fearsomeness,
Whoever sees them is intimidated and their breath is death.
People are afraid and do not approach it (their breath).
Išum is the door, shut in front of them.
Anu, king of the gods, inseminated the earth, and
she bore him 7 gods and he named them the Seven.
They stood before him and he determined their destinies.
He summoned the first to give (him) orders:
" Wherever you go off to rage, you shall not have an opponent."
He said to the second: " Scorch like fire and burn like a flame!"
He spoke to the third: " May you be provided with the appearance of a lion, so that whoever sees you dissolves."
He said to the fourth: " May a mountain be destroyed completely at the lifting of your furious weapons."
To the fifth he said: " Blow like the wind and scour the circumference (of the earth)!"
The sixth he instructed: " Go along above and below and spare nobody!"
The seventh he filled up with the venom of a poisonous snake so that he could wreck lives.
After Anu had determined the destinies of all of the Seven,
he gave them to Erra, hero of the gods, that they may go at his side,
(saying) " When the bustle of the people of the inhabited world displeases you,
" and your heart desires to accomplish defeat,
" to kill the black-headed people (and) to wreck the livestock of Sumuqan,
" may they be your furious weapons and may they go at your side." # the Seven now
(Now) they (the Seven) are furious and are raising their weapons.
They talk to Erra: " Get up and stand!
" Why do you sit in the city like a weakened old man?
" (Why) do you sit at home like a young child, a baby?
" Should we eat women's food like soldiers who do not go to the open country?
" Should we fear and tremble as if we do not know battle?
" Going to open country is like a festival for young men!
" The city-dweller, the noble, does not become sated with food.
" In the opinion of his people, he will be rejected and belittled
" as soon as he stretches out his hand against a soldier who does go to the open country.
" (Because) although the strength of a city-dweller can be very great,
" how can he be stronger than a soldier who does go to the open country?
" Luxurious city-bread is not worth (as much as) a charcoal-baked loaf. # or: "does not compare with"
" Thin, sweetened beer is not worth (as much as) water from a waterskin.
" A terraced palace is not worth (as much as) the shelters of ....
" Warrior Erra, go out to the open country and beat your weapons!
" Make your voice strong so that above and below shall shake!
" May the Igigi hear (it) and make your name great!
" May the Annunaku hear (it) and fear your name!
" May the gods hear (it) and submit to your yoke!
" May the rulers hear (it) and kneel before you!
" May the lands hear (it) and bring you their tribute!
" May the unimportant men hear (it) and die by their own (hand)! # Lambert translates the end: "Let them die spontaneously"
" May the powerful man hear (it) and may his strength diminish!
" May the high ... hear (it) and ...!
" May the rolling ... hear (it) and ...!
" May ... of the mighty forest be cleared away!
" May the ... of the reed-beds which have no entrance be snapped off!
" May the people be afraid and calm ...! # calm their bustle
" May the livestock tremble and turn ...!
" May the gods, your forefathers, see and praise ...!
" Warrior Erra, why did you abandon the open country to sit in the city?
" The livestock of Sumuqan and the animals scorn (us).
" Warrior Erra, we address you and our speech ....
" Until all the land becomes greater ...,
" you will certainly hear ....
"..., who love deathly hush, ... good:
"... cannot flow over ... the bustle of the people.
" Livestock is trampling ..., the pastureland.
"... weeps loud and bitterly ... his ....
" Lion ... wreck the livestock of Sumuqan.
" The shepherd cannot sleep ... at night ...; he pleads with you.
" Moreover, ... of the mountains, we have forgotten the way.
"... ... a spider's web.
"... resists and is stronger than our strength.
"... its blade ....
" Our sword ... has lain down rust." # new narrated part
The warrior Erra listened to them and
the word the Seven said was pleasing to him like the best oil. # a bit of flattery goes a long way...
He opened his mouth to speak to Išum: # speech by Erra
" Why, (though) you are hearing (this), do you sit by silently?
" Open the way and let me set off on a campaign.
" Let the Seven, unrivalled heroes, ...
" Make my furious weapons go at my side!
" And you, be my advance guard, be my rear guard!" # narrator
... Išum ... this,
he opened his mouth to speak to the warrior Erra: # speech Išum
" Lord Erra, why do you plan evil against ...?
" Without looking back, you are planning evil (namely) to flatten the lands (and) to destroy the people." # narrator
Erra opened his mouth to address
Išum, his advance guard. He spoke the word: # speech by Erra
" Išum, pay attention to me and listen to what I say!
" Concerning the people of the inhabited world about whom you say: ' Save them!'
" Advance guard of the gods, wise Išum, whose advice is good:
" I am the wild bull in heaven; I am the lion on earth;
" I am king in the land; I am the most furious among the gods;
" I am hero among the Igigi; I am the strongest among the Anunnaku;
" I am the hunter among livestock; I am the battering-ram into the mountain;
" I am fire in the reed-bed; I am the battleaxe in the forest;
" I am the standard when going on campaign.
" I blow like the wind; I rumble loudly like Adad;
" Like the sun, I check the circumference of everything.
" I am the wild sheep when I go out to open country.
" I enter the deserted land and take up residence in the animal stall.
" All the gods fear a fight
" and the black-headed people scorn (me).
" As for me - because they do not fear my name
" and disobey prince Marduk's word, he may act according to his heart -
" I will make prince Marduk furious, remove (him) from his dwelling and flatten the people." # end of speech Erra
The warrior Erra set his face towards Šuanna (Babylon), the city of the king of the gods (Marduk),
He entered Esaggil, palace of heaven and earth, and stood before him.
He opened his mouth to speak to the king of the gods: # speech Erra
" Why is the šukuttu-adornment, symbol of your lordship, which was full of splendour like the heavenly stars, taken with dirt ? # or "taken with dirt"
" (Why) is the face of the crown of your lordship, which made Ehalanki bright like Etemenanki, covered?" # narrator
The king of the gods opened his mouth to speak
to Erra, hero of the gods, and said: # speech Marduk
" Warrior Erra, concerning that work that you recommend to do: # Erra's list: the cleaning of the šukuttu requires Marduk to leave his seat...
" Long ago, I did become furious, left my dwelling and brought about the flood.
" When I left my dwelling, the judgement of heaven and earth was dispelled;
" The heavens were made to tremble, such that the positions of the heavenly stars changed and did not return to their place;
" The underworld rocked (in such a way) that the yield of the furrow diminished and became forever difficult to rely on. # or instead of rocked, "became weakened".
" The judgement of heaven and earth was dispelled (in such a way) that underground water diminished and high water receded. (When) I turned to look at (it), it had become difficult to undo (it).
" The creations of living beings depleted and did not return to their place,
" until, like a farmer, I could hold (all) their seed in my hand.
" I made a house and sat inside.
" (As to) the appearance of the šukuttu-adornment, which was pushed away in the flood and had become dark:
" I commanded the Fire-god to make my countenance shine and to cleanse my garments.
" After he made the šukuttu-adornment bright and finished the work for me,
" I dressed in the crown of my lordship and returned to my place.
" My appearance was haughty and my look fearsome!
" The people who were left behind in the flood, saw the accomplishment of the work.
" Should I (now) set my weapons in motion and destroy the rest?
" I made those craftsmen descend to the Apsu and did not command them to go up. # the craftsmen who made the šukuttu
" I changed the place of the mēsu-tree and amber and did not show anybody. # šukuttu was made of @mēsu-wood and stone.
" Now then, warrior Erra, concerning that work that you recommend:
" Where is the mēsu-tree, flesh of the gods, symbol of the king of the universe?
" The pure tree, exalted young man, which is appropriate to lordship,
" The roots of which reached the depths of the Underworld, 1 hundred bēru into the wide sea.
" Its crest is in contact with the heaven of Anu above.
" Where is the bright zagindurû-stone which I removed ...?
" Where is Ninildum, the master joiner of my divinity,
"... pure ... of Šamaš, who knows that ..., who ... like the day, # bearer of the pure axe of Šamaš
"... beneath me ....
" Where is Kusibanda, creator of ...?
" Where is Ninagal, bearer of ...,
" who ... hard copper like ...?
" Where are the precious stones ...?
" Where are the 7 sages of the Apsu ..., who are perfect ... like Ea, cleansers ...?" # narrator
Warrior Erra heard him and ...;
he opened his mouth ...: # Erra
"... ... and ...
" I shall send down ... his ... ...
" I shall send down ... ... ... his ... ..." # narrator
When Marduk heard ...,
he opened his mouth to speak to warrior Erra: # Marduk
"... the judgement of heaven and earth will become dispelled.
"... will overtake the land.
"... darkness ... ... ...
"... will arise and the heavenly stars ....
"... will blow and ... of people, living beings ....
"... will go up and ... will seize ....
"... who confronts them with ungirt loincloth.
" The Anunnaku will go up and ... the living beings.
" As long as I have not put on my weapons, ...?" # narrator
When Erra heard this,
he opened his mouth to speak ...: # Erra's insincere promises:
" Prince Marduk, while you enter into ... house and the Fire-god cleanses your garment, and (until) you return to your place,
" until that time I will lead and reinforce the judgement of heaven and earth.
" I will go up to heaven and ... an order to the Igigi.
" I will go down to Apsu (and) care for the Anunnaku.
" I will send off the furious gallû-demons to the Land Of No Return and
" make my furious weapons triumph against them.
" I will bind the wings of the evil wind like a bird's.
" At that house which you will enter, prince Marduk,
" on the right and on the left of your gate, I will make Anu and Ellil lie in wait like oxen." # narrator
Prince Marduk heard him and
the word Erra said pleased him.
He got up from his dwelling, an inaccessible place, and set his face towards the dwelling of the Anunnaku.

... (of) his arrival
... " Open the gate to me!"
" Enter ... and may the gate bless you!"
He brought ... Kakka in ..., # I put ... before Kakka because it is the "god Kakka" according to following lines.
He brought ... Kakka in through the ... gate,
He brought ... Kakka in through the third gate,
He brought the god Kakka in through the fourth gate,
He brought the god Kakka in through the fifth gate,
He brought the god Kakka in through the sixth gate,
He brought the god Kakka in through the seventh gate.
He then entered into her wide court, he knelt (and) kissed the ground in front of her; he straightens, stands ... speaks to her:
" Anu, your father, sent me ... saying:
' As for you, you are not to come up. During your year, you will not come up in front of us, and as for us, we are not to go down. During our month, we will not come down in front of you.
' Let your messenger come, let him clear away the offering table, let him receive your presents. Whatever I give him, let him deliver ... safely to you'." # First then is to render the -ma
Ereškigal opened her (lit. his) mouth to speak; she said (these) words to Kakka:
" Messenger of Anu, our father, who has come to us, may health be with Anu, Ellil and Ea, the Great Gods. May health be with Nammu and the pure Nanše. May health be with the husband of the lady of the heavens. May health be with Ninurta the mightiest in the land."
Kakka opened his mouth to speak; he said (these) words to Ereškigal:
" Health is with Anu, Ellil and Ea the great gods. Health is with Nammu and the pure Nanše. Health is ... the lady of the heavens. Health is with Ninurta, the mightiest in the land."
Kakka opened his mouth to speak; he said (these) words to Ereškigal:
"... ... may (all) be well with you."
... opened his mouth to speak; she said (these) words to Namtar, her (lit. his) minister:
" Namtar, my minister, let me send you to ... Anu, our father. Namtar, go up the long ..., clear away the offering table ..., whatever Anu ...." # I guess it would be safe to restore Ereškigal here (although possessive suffixes are masc. but it happens all the time in this text and SpTU)

"... who dwell inside the Underworld, why don't you kneel in front of him?

... ... ... ...
... ...
... ...
... ... ...
... let me arise ...
... ... you said
... ... as much as the god ..., I will twine it double
On hearing this speech, Ea said to himself: " Let me work on (that) and ... to send."
Ea opened his mouth to speak; he said to Nergal:
" Traveller, do you wish to go on your mission? Draw the sword in your hand, go down to the forest ... of the mēsu-trees. Cut down the mēsu-tree, the white cedar and the supālu-juniper, break off (the branches) of the kanakātu-tree and the sibbirru-tree."
Nergal, (on) hearing this ... ... ... ... supālu-juniper, he broke off (the branches of) the ... and (of) the sibbirru-tree, and thereafter ... ... for Anu and Ningišzida.
In the likeness of lapis-lazuli, he painted his ...,
In the likeness of gold, he painted ... ...,
In the likeness of lapis-lazuli, he painted ....
The work completed, (that was) all of the throne!
And then, he (Ea) called out to him (Nergal) and gave him ... instructions: " Traveller, do you wish to go? Whatever instructions ... ... in ( your) heart ....
" As soon as they offer you a chair: do not look at it and do not sit on it.
" (When) the cook offers you bread: do not look at his bread, you must not eat (it).
" (When) the butcher offers you meat: do not look at his meat, ditto (you must not eat it).
" (When) the brewer offers you beer: do not look at his beer, you must not drink it.
" (When) he offers you water for washing (your) feet: do not look at it, do not wash your feet.
" (When) she enters the bath and the garment ... is put on ... she will let you see her body. As for you, ... man or woman, do not ...." # I chose to alternate "do not" and "you must not" because formulations are different in Akkadian; but it could also be a scribal mistake.
Nergal ...

" Let me bring back instructions ... to my lady (lit. lord)."
Namtar went and, in the shadow of the door, gazed at Erra.
Namtar's face became yellow-green like a tamarisk cutting, his lips become black like the lip of a kunninu-basin.
Namtar went and said (these) words to his lady:
" My lady, from ... you sent me to your father and into the court ... (at) my entrance, they were kneeling, they were humble ... they were kneeling."

The cook offers him bread: " do not look at the bread"; he did not eat (it).
The butcher offers him meat: " do not look at his meat"; ditto (he did not eat it).

... opened the mouth to speak; ... said these words to his lady:

... tears rain; her tears flow (all) over her cheeks:
" Erra, (my) husband, (full of) sexual charms, I am not sated with his sexual charms, (yet) he goes off me. Erra, (my) husband, (full of) sexual charms, I am not sated with his sexual charms, (yet) he goes off me."
Namtar opened his mouth to speak; he said to Ereškigal:
"... ... ... ... indeed I wish to seize that god; let me take him to you."
... (to) Anu, Ellil and Ea ..., saying:
" Since I was small, since I was a young girl, I have not known the playing of maidens, I have not known the gamboling of young girls.
"... You have sent him to me and he indeed had sexual intercourse with me. Let him lie down with me. Do send him to me. Let him be my husband, let him spend the night with me. I am indeed the impure one, I am not pure; I cannot render the judgement of the Great Gods. # "indeed" for ma (used to emphasize)
" Great Gods, who dwell inside the Underworld, if you do not send that god, in accordance with ... and the Great Underworld, I will raise the dead and make them devour the living, I will make the dead more numerous than the living!" # Lit. "I will raise (the dead) and they will devour the living"
Namtar climbed up the long stairways of the heavens.
At his arrival at the gate of Anu, Ellil and Ea, Anu, Ellil and Ea saw him and (asked): " Why do you come, Namtar?"
" Your daughter sent me, saying: ' Since I was small, (since) I was a young girl, I have not known the playing of maidens, I have not known the gamboling of young girls.
' That god, whom you sent, had indeed sexual intercourse with me. Let him lie down .... Send that god to me. Let him be my husband, let him spent the night with me .... I am indeed the impure one, I am not pure; I will not render the judgement ....
Great gods, who dwell inside the Underworld, if you do not send that god to me (lit. him), I will raise the dead and make them devour the living, I will make the dead more numerous than the living!'"
Ea opened his mouth ... said: " Namtar, to the court ...
... ... ... ...."
At his entrance into ..., they were kneeling ... all of them, they were kneeling ... of the land.
The first ... saw that god; ... he went straight to the third and he did not see that god.
Namtar came (back) to his Lady and said (these) words:
" My Lady ... Anu, your father, to whom you sent me, my Lady, ... he is bald, he is squinting, he is crippled ... sitting in the assembly of all the gods."
" Go, seize that god and take (him) to me! Ea, his father, has sprinkled him with water of the source and he is bald, he is squinting, he is crippled ... the assembly of all gods."
Namtar climbed up the long stairways of the heavens.
At his arrival at the gate of Anu, Ellil and Ea, Anu, Ellil and Ea saw him and (asked): " Why do you come, Namtar?"
" Your daughter sent me, saying ' Seize that god and take (him) to me!'"
" Namtar, enter into the court of Anu, seek for your evildoer and take him!"
He went straight to the first (one) but did not see ...; he went straight (to) the 3rd (one) but ... went straight ....
... opened his mouth to speak; ... to Ea ...:

Nergal ... the long stairways of the heavens; when he reached the gate of Ereškigal:
" Gatekeeper, open the gate to me!"
The gatekeeper of the gate of ... hung up his ... (at) the gate and did not grant (him) entrance,

He entered into her wide court, approached her and laughed. He seized her by her headdress. ... from the top ... .... He seized her by her locks.
As much as the love of his heart, both the brother and the sister are embracing. Passionately indeed, they have entered into the bed.

Quickly, he is favourable to me as ...
Let me teach the people ... is close.
His favourable understanding ....
From the day the Lord ... and the hero Bel got angry ...
my (own) god rejected me, (then) disappeared ...; my (own) goddess became inactive (and) went away ...; the protective deity of welfare, who ... at my side split away; my own tutelary deity got scared and sought another one.
My dignity has been taken away, my virility has been veiled; my rank has been cut off, my protection has been torn away.
Signs of terror have been laid upon me;
I was expelled from my house, I wandered outside;
my omens are obscure, they are contradictory for ever;
my course has not been decided by the signs of the diviner or the dream interpreter.
According to the rumour of the street, my reputation is bad.
(When) I sleep at night, my dream is terrifying.
(As for) the king, flesh of the gods, sun of his people: his heart has been bound and the dispelling (of demons) has become evil.
The attendants keep exchanging denigrating talk against me; they are gathering together and they point at (me with) maliciousness.
If the first one (says): " I will make him spill his life", the second says: " I removed (him) from his office";
thus the third: " I will grab his appointment";
" I will enter his house" swears the fourth;
the fifth is inciting fifty (against) me;
the sixth and the seventh will follow like his protective deity.
They have gathered around me: their band is a knot of 7.
As merciless as a storm, similar to utukku-demons, ... their flesh is one and they are (all) set with (one) mouth.
... they became wild against me and they were burning like fire.
They persuaded obstacles ... against me.
They have muzzled ... as with a bridle.
... had prattled; I became like a deaf man.
... fled silently.
(Once) so high, my head bowed down to the ground;
My heart, (once) so steady, is shaken in terror;
(Once) so wide, my chest ... by the youngest;
My arms, (once) far-reaching, are (now) ... and grasp each other;
I, who had gone about like a lord, learnt to slink.
I had been splendid, but I turned into a slave.
Within my large family, I have become alone.
(When) I go along the street, fingers point (at me).
(When) I enter the palace, eyes squint (at me).
My (own) city frowns at me like my enemy.
My (own) country is ferocious (against me) as if it were hostile.
My (own) brother has turned into a stranger.
My (own) friend has turned into a foe and a demon.
A furious companion denounced me.
My employees defile me constantly with their weapons.
My (formerly) friendly colleagues slander my life.
My (own) slave cursed me, openly, in the assembly; my (own) maid spoke slander of me in front of the common people.
(When) he sees me, (my) acquaintance take refuge on the side.
My (own) family does not place me (as) its (own) flesh.
As for the one who speaks kindly of me, a trap will open for him; the eloquent one who slanders me will be placed at the top.
(As for) the one who talks (with) maliciousness of me, the god is his helper.
The one who says " it is enough!", his haste is death;
(For) the one who (provides) no assistance life becomes like (that of) a protective deity.
I have neither acquired someone at my side, nor seen a merciful one.
To the riffraff, they distributed all that was mine.
They blocked up the mouth of my canal with silt.
In my meadows, they drove away the work song.
Like the city of my enemy, they put silence (in my) city.
They let another take my office ...; they appointed a stranger ....
One year and the next, the appointed time has passed.
I turned round: (everywhere was) evil, it was evil indeed.
My misfortune keeps increasing; I will not find righteousness.
I called out to my (own) god, but he did not pay attention to me.
I appeal to my goddess, (but) she does not support me.
The diviner, through divination, has not determined (the future).
With the incense, my dream interpreter did not proclaim the sentence.
I supplicated Zaqiqu but he did not inform me.
The incantation priest, during the rituals, did not loosen the wrath (of the gods).
What machinations, for one year, in all lands!
I look at my legacy: (all) persecution and conflict!
Like the one who has not set up his offerings to the god and during (whose) meals the goddess was not invoked; (like the one who) has not changed ..., (who) has not experienced prostration;
... prayers (and) petitions have been discontinued; (like the one who) has ceased ... of the god, (who) has become neglectful (during) the eššēšu-festival;
(like the one who) is negligent; (the one who) has neglected their purification (rituals);
(like the one who) never had his kin learn reverence (for the gods and) observance (of the rites);
(like the one who) has not invoked his god (when) he ate his bread;
(like the one who) has abandoned his goddess; (like the one who) has not brought his mashātu-offering;
like (lit. for) the one who raved; (like the one who) forgets about his lord;
(like the one who) swears ... on the life of his respected god: I am indeed (their) equal.
I mentioned myself in prayers and petitions;
Petitions were common sense (for me); sacrifices were my rites.
The days when I was revering the god were a contentment for me; the day of Ištar's procession were my profit, my gain; prayer for the king: that was my joy! And his joyful song was turned into ....
I directed my land to the observance of ...; I continually instructed my kin to honour the goddess's name.
I rendered the praise for the king equal to the god's and I had the common people learn respect for the palace.
Let me know these (things) that are always acceptable for the gods!
... oneself ( is) sin to the god;
... is wretched, is good to his god.
... will learn ... inside heavens?
Who will understand ...?
... the god's way ... humanity.
The one who lived with strength is dying ....
Quickly, they become dark ... they merrily create noise. ## Merrily nuance is suggested by CDA for Dt.
At one moment, they sing a cheerful song; in the next instant, ... they are very loud.
Their opinions are as contradictory as opening and closing.
When they are hungry, they become like corpses; when they are replete, they rival (with) their gods.
When they are in good condition, they speak (of) climbing up to heavens; when they are confused, they claim to descend to the Underworld.
I have thought about these; I have not understood their meanings.
... as for me, miserable, a storm pursues (me).
Debilitating illness advances over me.
A destructive winds blow ... ( from) the sky.
My Headache springs up from bowels of the earth.
An evil cough emerges from its Apsu.
... not ... comes out from the Ekur.
... descended from inside the mountains.
... ( from) the flood, the frost ... ...

... they struck ...

They disturbed my bowels ....
They afflicted (me) ..., causing the flowing of phlegm.
They afflicted my limbs; they shifted ....
They brought down my tall body ....
They flattened my wide figure like rushes.
As a dried fig is overturned, (I am) face down ....
The alû-demon has clothed himself (with) my body (as) a garment.
... covered me like a battle net.
... are staring but do not see.
... are open but do not hear.
Paralysis has taken all my body. ## would "my whole body" be more correct? If yes, do I have to add the sense to kalû?
A stroke has affected my flesh.
A skin disease has seized my arms.
Debility has affected my knees.
My feet have forgotten (how) to move.
A blow has overcome (me): I choke suddenly.
Death has recovered my face.
... I will answer.
... I did not have ....
... my lips
... my watering places ...

If ... I swallowed (it) up like a foetid plant
... subsistence for the people, ... on me
moreover, my sickness has become long.
Without meal, my face ....
My flesh has become loose; my blood has ebbed away ....
My bones are etched, covered ....
My veins are swollen; jaundice strikes me.
I took to my bed; my way out is (in) moaning.
My (own) house turned into my jail.
Handcuffs of my (own) flesh are laid (around) my arms.
Chains (all around) myself; my feet are wasted through disease, .
My beatings are very painful; my wound is strong.
A whip, covered with thorns, beats me.
A goad pricks me; stings ....
All day long, a persecutor pursues me.
... (at) night, they do not let me breathe.
... being inverted, ... is released.
... are scattered; they are dropped in equal shares.
I spent the night ... like an ox.
... (in) my excrement.
... the incantation priest, and my omens have confused ....
The exorcist did not reveal the nature of my illness and the diviner did not give a fixed date for (the end of) my sickness.
(My own) god did not rush to help; he did not seize my hand; my (own) goddess was not merciful to me; she did not walk on my side.
(My) grave is open; my ornaments are ready.
Before my death, the mourning for me was completed.
All my country said: " How wronged he has been!".
Those who gloat over me hear (this) and their faces brighten; they deliver pleasant news to the woman who gloats over me, her mood becomes cheerful.
Dark is the day for all my family; amongst my friends, their sun has become dark.

Nabu, may he who trusts in you not be ashamed!
A young man, a citizen of Nippur, needy and poor,
Gimil-Ninurta was his name, a very unfortunate man,
Was living in his city Nippur in great misery:
He had no silver, as appropriate to his fellow men,
Gold he did not have, as appropriate to people;
His grain-bins were deprived of pure grain.
For want of bread, his innards were burnt,
For want of meat and first-class beer, unfortunate was his appearance.
Every day, in the absence of a meal, he slept hungrily.
He was clothed in garments without a change.
With his unfortunate heart he pondered:
" I will strip off my garments without a change,
" (And) on the square of my city Nippur, I will by a ram."
(So) he stripped off his garments without a change,
(And) on the square of his city Nippur, he bought a three-year-old goat.
With his unfortunate heart he pondered:
" Perhaps I could slaughter the goat in my yard,
" (But then) there would be no meal (for) where is the beer?
" The neighbours in my city quarter would hear (of it) and be angry,
" Family and clan would be offended with me.
" (No,) I will take the goat and bring it to the house of the mayor.
" I will wish all the best for his stomach."
Gimil-Ninurta grasped the neck of his goat,
(And) he ... to the gate of the burgomaster of Nippur.
To Tukulti-Ellil, the keeper of the gate, he said:
" Say that I want to enter and see Mr Mayor!"
The gatekeeper said to his master:
" My lord, a citizen of Nippur is waiting at your gate,
" And as greeting-gift (and) present he has brought you a goat."
The burgomaster became angry with the gatekeeper Tukulti-Ellil (and said):
" Why is a citizen of Nippur ... at the gate?"
The gatekeeper ... to ....
Gimil-Ninurta, as his heart rejoiced, entered into the presence of the burgomaster.
When Gimil-Ninurta entered into the presence of Mr Mayor,
In his left hand he grasped the neck of his goat,
With his right hand he greeted the mayor:
" May Enlil and Nippur bless the mayor!
" May Ninurta and Nusku make him (and) and his descendants flourish!"
The burgomaster said to the citizen of Nippur:
" What is the wrong done to you that you bring me a present?"
Gimil-Ninurta repeated his desire to the mayor of Nippur.
" Every day, in the absence of a meal, I sleep hungrily,
" (So) I stripped off my garments without a change,
" (And) on the square of my city Nippur, I bought a three-year-old goat.
" To my oppressed heart I said thus:
" ' Perhaps I could slaughter the goat in my yard,
" (But then) there would be no meal (for) where is the beer?
" The neighbours in my city quarter would hear (of it) and be angry,
" Family and clan would be offended with me.
" (No,) I will bring the goat to the house of the mayor.'
"... ... my furious heart.
... ... the butcher cries out at night.
... ... and may they be captured.
... ... may the table be very plentiful ...
... ... may they consider.
... ... he shouted.
... ... ...
" Give him, the citizen of Nippur, a bone and a sinew,
" Give him beer (diluted to) one-third to drink in your rhyton,
" Chase him away and expel him from the gate!"
He gave him, the citizen of Nippur, a bone and a sinew,
He gave him beer (diluted to) one-third to drink in his rhyton,
He chased him away and expelled him from the gate.
As Gimil-Ninurta was leaving the gate,
He said to the gatekeeper, the keeper of the gate:
" Greetings of the gods for your master! Say to him thus:
" ' Because of the one burden which you imposed on me
" For that one, I will requite you three times!' "
(When) the burgomaster heard (this), he laughed all day.
Gimil-Ninurta (now) set his face towards the ruler's palace,
" By the order of the king, the prince and the military governor will settle a just case."
When Gimil-Ninurta entered into the presence of the ruler,
He prostrated himself and kissed the ground before him,
He raised his hands to greet the king of the world.
" O lord, pride of the people, king whose lamassu-deity is splendid.
" May they give me one chariot at your command!
" That, for one day, whatever I wish for, I may achieve (my) desire.
" For my day, my debt will be one mina of red gold."
The ruler did not ask him: " What is your desire
" That you want to parade a whole day in one chariot?"
They gave him a new chariot, as appropriate to noblemen,
They tied a sash on him ... ... him.
He mounted the new chariot, as appropriate to noblemen,
(And) set his face towards his city Duranki (= Nippur).
(En route) Gimil-Ninurta caught two birds,
Gathered (them) into a box and sealed it with his seal.
(Then) he moved on to the gate of the burgomaster of Nippur.
The mayor went outside into his presence:
" Who are you, my lord, that you are travelling at dusk?"
" The king, your lord, sent me to the centre of Duranki (= Nippur).
" I have brought gold for the Ekur, Ellil's temple."
The burgomaster slaughtered a ram to make an abundant meal.
Ditto (the burgomaster) said to him, in his presence: " Woe, I am tired!"
Gimil-Ninurta was on his guard at the head of the burgomaster (through) one watch of the night.
The burgomaster, in his weariness, was overcome by sleep.
Secretly, Gimil-Ninurta stood up in the middle of the night and
Opened the lid of that box; the birds flew off to the heavens.
The burgomaster, at the rising of the morning star ... and ... the box.
" The lid of the box is open and the gold is taken away!"
Gimil-Ninurta, with his wailing heart, rent his attire,
He fell on top of the mayor and made him lift his hands in prayer.
From his head to the soles of his feet,
he thrashed his limbs (and) inflicted grief upon him.
The mayor beneath him pleaded for himself and cried out:
" My lord, do not destroy a citizen of Nippur!
" Do not stain your hands with the blood of a protégé, taboo of Ellil!"
They gave him as a gift 2 minas of red gold,
Instead of his attire which he had rent, he gave him others.
As Gimil-Ninurta was leaving the gate,
He said to Tukulti-Ninurta, the keeper of the gate:
" Greetings of the gods for your master! Say to him thus:
" ' Because of the one burden which you imposed upon me,
" I have requited you one, two remain.' "
The mayor heard (this) and ... all day.
Gimil-Ninurta ... into the presence of the barber,
He shaved off all (his) hair on the left side ....
He filled a blackened bowl ....
He ... to the gate of Mr Mayor of Nippur.
(And) said to the gatekeeper, the keeper of the gate:
" Say that I want to enter and see ...."
" Who are you that you should see ...?"
" A physician, born in Isin, examiner ...,
" Where illness and suffering in the body ...."
When Gimil-Ninurta entered into the presence of Mr Mayor,
He showed him his wound where he had thrashed his body.
The burgomaster said to his eunuchs: " The physician is competent."
" My lord, my treatments (only) succeed in darkness."
Where access is blocked, a very dark way,
He made him enter, and in the inaccessible room,
Where friends and companions could not show him mercy,
He threw the bowl into the fire,
And drove five pegs into the solid ground.
He tied his hands, feet and head (to them).
From (his) head to the soles of his feet, he thrashed his limbs (and) inflicted grief upon him.
As Gimil-Ninurta was leaving the gate,
He said to Tukulti-Ellil, the keeper of the gate:
" Greetings of the gods for your master! Say to him thus:
" ' Because of the one burden which you imposed upon me,
" I have requited you a second (time), one remains.' "
Gimil-Ninurta was very distressed; like a dog, he raised his ears,
He examined the entirety of the black-headed ones (and) watched all the people.
He looked at one young man, ... ... ... anything ....
He gave him as his gift ... ...:
" Go to the gate of Mr Mayor ... cry out
" so that all the extensive people may gather at your cry:
" ' I am making my way back to the gate of the burgomaster! I am the one with the goat!' "
(Meanwhile) Gimil-Ninurta was lying in wait beneath the bridge, like a dog.
At the cry of the young man, Mr Mayor went outside,
He sent out the personnel of his house, female and male,
And they flew off, in their totality, to look for the young man.
While they were all ditto (looking for the young man),
Mr Mayor ... ... on his own in the countryside.
Gimil-Ninurta sprang out from beneath the bridge (and) seized Mr Mayor.
He fell on top of Mr Mayor, (and) made him lift his hands in prayer.
From his head to the soles of his feet,
He thrashed his limbs (and) inflicted grief upon him.
" Because of the one burden which you imposed upon me,
" I have requited you three times."
He left him and went out into the open country,
The mayor, crawling, entered into the city.
... written and checked.

he gave the goat's head for the man's head;
he gave the goat's neck for the man's neck;
he gave the goat's chest for the man's chest;
he gave the goat's right side for the man's right side;

If you presented an offering and in the slaughtering of the sheep blood did not come out, ... you opened the innards of the sheep and if the vertebrae were sunken or the gall bladder was missing from the omen, or if the Finger (on the liver) was missing, or if the Increment (on the liver) was missing, or the coils (of the colon) were heaped up, or a kidney was missing, or the divination twitched, or ... ominous parts have been removed, or a huge ominous part was displayed in the innards of the sheep, to avert that (predicted) evil and for it not to approach the man, (you do as follows).
Its ritual: he goes to the temple of Marduk and prays. He speaks as follows.
Great lord, Marduk, merciful god, because of what is missing (from the offering), the evil of the gall bladder that has been placed on me, and the merciless ominous part, I am confused and troubled.
Lord Marduk, make (the evil) pass me by and let it settle on the outskirts. He speaks thus.

My house, I will remove my evils (and) your evils.
I will tear out the evil ominous part, I will tear out the instructions that my god and my goddess placed on me.
He recites this 7 times and where there is no crossroads, where access is blocked, you set up a censer (full) of juniper and he speaks as follows.
You, great gods of the night, whom Anu and Ellil created:
You will cancel the evil signs that keep on occurring against me and you will remove from the house of the man the evil ominous part that has been placed in his omen.

Because of the evil of the portents in the ominous part that has been placed on me, I am frightened, I am afraid and I am constantly terrified.

When Kulla has gone down into the house, drawings are made with šigūšu-flour and ennēnu-flour.
A place for Ea and a reed hut are laid out.
(There is) food (consisting) of a mersu-cake for Ea, Marduk and Usmu, (as well as for) the god of the house, the goddess of the house (and) the protective spirit of the house.
An offering is presented. Water is raised.
He appeases Ea and Marduk and the āšipu-priest speaks to Ea and Marduk as follows.
(That is) the sequence for the ritual procedures.
Ea and Marduk, lords of heaven and earth, you (are) the builders of city and house.
Determining destinies (and) drawing up plans (are) in your hands.
It is you who determine the destinies of life.
It is you who draw up the plans of life.
... ....
May he (the house's owner) always do ....
May he always be joyful ....
May he achieve ... (which) he strives for.
... the things that exist, may he always renew them.
(That is) the wording of the prayer.
Kulla arises. He is brought out from the house.
Two torches (are) in front of him.
They call out ' Depart, evilly-striking demon!', (and) ditto (again).
(There are) 2 censers (full) of emmer flour, deer horn, cress, nīnû-plant (and) sulphur; 2 date-palm buds; 2 ēru-trees; 2 live sheep; 2 scapegoats; 2 sacrificial goats; 2 tamarisks; 2 whips; 2 kušgugalû-drums; 2 nigkalagû-drums; barley offerings; (and) 2 offering vessels.
The shouters shout out ' At the front of the house, reclining man, arise!'.
The man answers ' Depart, evilly-striking demon!'.
He brings out the ritual assemblage for the evilly-striking demon.
(That is) the sequence for the evilly-striking demon.
' At the front of the house, reclining man, arise!',
' At the front of the house, ...', ' To the front of the house',
' Evil god, who are you?', ' Evil udug-demon (and) severe ghost of the land',

When Kulla has gone out from the house,
7 drawings are made on the outer gate.
7 offering vessels are shattered.
7 date-palm buds (and) 7 ēru-trees are planted.
They lead Kulla to the bank of a watercourse together with his provisions.
They sit him down in a meadow by the watercourse.
Food (consisting) of a mersu-cake is set in place for Ea and Marduk.
An offering is presented. (There are also) bread (baked) in charcoal (and) 2 twin-vessels which are filled with billatu-beer.
He scatters a censer.
Before Ea and Marduk the mašmaššu-priest speaks as follows in front of the watercourse.
(That is) the sequence for the ritual procedures.

The āšipu-priest speaks as follows:

You allocate (it) in front of him.
After you have completed the ritual assemblage, the mašmaššu-priest stands in front of Ea and Marduk and recites ' Ea and Marduk, lords of heaven (and) earth' 3 times.
When he has recited (it), you clear away all the ritual assemblages and the builder raises Kulla and he removes Kulla's allocation, head (and) nose, as much as there is, and the mašmaššu-priest raises a spade (made) of copper and scrapes the dust off the altar-base of Kulla on the roof of the house and off the door-jambs.

Incantation: " May Namtar speak!
His Namtar speaks; his Namtar cancels (the curse).
All the gods together"
You keep performing (the ritual) next to Namtar (and) Giru. Incantation formula.
(You recite) this incantation 7 times; you pour oil on the middle (of it); you annoint Namtar and he will tell you whatever you ask him.
Incantation: " His Namtar has spoken! His Namtar has spoken!
Rejoice: his Namtar has spoken!

What did I do wrong, that you will turn me into clay?

He climbs up the mountain, he goes down the mountain ( where) he has pulled out the anameru-plant by its roots.

I am so-and-so, descendant of so-and-so, to whom a child is bound in my dream, and will not be released. I have faced you Šamaš, great lord, for the sake of the separation".
You recite this three times in front of Šamaš and the distressed one raises that figurine in his left hand (then) in his right (hand). He addresses Šamaš; Šamaš listens (to him); he swears (by) his word and speaks thus to the substitute, to the figurine:
Incantation: " You, whoever you are who always appear by me in dream and vision, now, in front of Šamaš, you are taken away, you are driven away and you are chased off.
The open country begot you, as your father (did).

At sunrise, you break off clay; you make the figurines of a man and a woman; the figurine of the man is pushed away.
After you have set it up, you select the figurine of the woman, the throne-bearer; you annoint them (with) orpiment. You make the male's figurine right eye iridescent; you make his left eye tiqqûtu-coloured;
you clothe it in a one day garment. (As for) the figurine of the woman, you clothe it with a multicoloured garment; you sit them down on a throne before Šamaš; you write their names on their left hips. The name of the man (is): " That evil man will seize the breast".

You bring shoulder, fatty tissue and roast meat; you step back and you remove the figurine of the man from his right, the figurine of the woman from his left; you seize the distressed one's hand and you make him speak as follows:

Humbaba opened his mouth to speak, saying to Gilgameš:
' Let idiots, Gilgameš, consult a very stupid man. Why did you come into my presence?
' Come, Enkidu, spawn of a fish, who did not know his father,
' hatchling of a raqqu-turtle and a šeleppû-turtle, who did not suck his mother's milk!
' In your youth I would look at you but I would not approach you,
'... ... in my belly.
'... did you bring Gilgameš into my presence with evil intent,
' and (why) did you yourself stand like a foreign enemy?
' Let me cut the throat and neck ... Gilgameš,
' let me feed his flesh to cricket birds, screecher eagles, and vultures.'
Gilgameš opened his mouth to speak, saying to Enkidu:
' My friend, Humbaba's face has changed.
' Mightily we have come up to his place to defeat him himself,
' but the heart that feared does not quickly calm down.'
Enkidu opened his mouth to speak, saying ... Gilgameš:
' Why, my friend, do you speak like a weakling?
' And your mouth slackened, troubling my heart.
' Now, my friend, one ... ... ....

'... ... make your blow strong!'
(Humbaba saying:) '... ... may they (Gilgameš and Enkidu) be driven off.'
He heard them ... a distance,
he smote the very ground, ... he confronted him (Gilgameš).
At the heels of their feet the ground was splitting,
as they circled, Sirara and Lebanon were sundered.
White cloud was turned black,
death raining down on them like fog.
Šamaš raised against Humbaba the great storm-winds:
south wind, north wind, east wind, west wind, blast,
counterblast, gale, destructive wind, typhoon,
demon wind, icy blast, storm wind, dust storm.
The 13 winds arose and Humbaba's face darkened -
he cannot push forwards, he cannot kick backwards -
and the weapons of Gilgameš conquered Humbaba.
Humbaba sought his life, saying to Gilgameš:
' You are young, Gilgameš, (as when) your mother gave birth to you,
' but you are the offspring of Rimat-Ninsun.
' By the command of Šamaš also the mountains ...,
' a very shoot from Uruk's midst is the king Gilgameš.

' Now, Enkidu, my release lies with you:
' speak to Gilgameš, so that he may spare my life!'
Enkidu opened his mouth to speak, saying to Gilgameš:
' My friend, Humbaba, guardian of the forest of cedar,

' Humbaba, guardian of the forest, finish him off, kill him, destroy his nature,

Gilgameš was cutting down trees, Enkidu was constantly looking for the best timber.
Enkidu opened his mouth to speak, saying to Gilgameš:
' My friend, we have cut down a tall cedar,
' whose top abutted the heavens.
' I made a door, whose height is 6 rods, whose width is 2 rods,

The short side is 1 hundred cubits. What length should I survey be so that (the area is) 1 kurru seed-measure? Because you do not understand, you raise the reciprocal of the short side of the area and then you multiply times the reciprocal of the constant of seed-measure. And you multiply the seed-measure of your plot, so that you see the length. If your cubit is 0;05, 1 hundred cubits is 8;20. The reciprocal of 8;20 is 0;07 12. You multiply 0;07 12 times 0;01 12 so that (you see) 0;00 09. You multiply 0;00 09 by 5 00 00 so that (you see) 45. You put 45 as the length of your field.

' the woman, the mother, Ningal, has gone out from the city.
' I (am) your lord who roams around and does not sleep.
' I (am) ... did not eat bread ... his weariness. I (am) one who did not drink water in his weariness.
' Sand has been heaped up ... my house. Dust has been piled up. O dignitary, the one of wailing does not restrain wailing.
' The prince squats on the ground ... lamentation for his city. The tempest arose. It covered dust over the face.
' The storm (is) the word of Anu. The storm (is) the word of Ellil. The storm (is) the rage in the heart of great Anu.
' I (am) a Dilmunite whose ship sank in the reed-thickets.
' I (am) one who has a heart but does not have strength : woe, my heart, woe, (my) emotions.
' The processional boat which delivered food offerings has delivered distress (instead).
' The one (in charge) of the food offerings did not bring in the food offerings : the one (in charge) of the libations did not bring in the libations.'
This (is) what was sung to Sin at the eclipse. : You lay out an altar at the gate of the temple of the gods and (in) the square.
You pile cedar, cypress, myrtle, sweet reed, tamarisk of the mountain and twigs of ēru-tree on the altar.
As the eclipse begins, a temple-enterer lights a torch and kindles (fire) at the altar.
A kalû-priest sits and performs the ritual procedure in the domain of the kalû-priest until the eclipse has become light.
Until the eclipse becomes light, the fire on the altar must not be extinguished.
You make funerary offerings for the fallow meadows. Ditto funerary offerings for the watercourses which do not carry water.
You make funerary offerings to the Anunnakku.
Until the eclipse becomes light, the people of the land, their head garments taken off, their heads covered with (just) their pieces of cloth, cry out ' May confinement, murder, rebellion and the eclipse not come close to Uruk, Reš, Irigal, Baramah, Eana and the temples of the gods of Tirana'.
They raise their voice on account of lamentation.
7 soldiers, people of the land, their faces, their hands and their feet smeared with mud from the watercourse -- you hang a sword on their right collarbones -- cry out ' May confinement, murder, rebellion and the eclipse not come close to Uruk, Reš, Irigal, Baramah, Eana and the temples of the gods of Tirana'.
They raise their voice on account of lamentation.
Until the eclipse becomes clear they cry out.
As soon as Sin lightens the eclipse, you extinguish the fire on the altar with beer.
On the next day a builder lifts up the altar together with its ash and throws (it) into a watercourse.
On the next day, before Šamaš rises, you open the gates which you have sealed. You ... the standard, magic circle (and) white and black twine. You throw (them) into a watercourse. You wipe clean with purification ceremonies all the temples of the gods, and (in particular) the Edumununa, the temple of Sin. Sin is clothed. The holy water vessels are set up.
(You say, written in Sumerian and then Akkadian:) ' Adjure them by the life of Anu and Ellil.'
One mašmaššu-priest on the right of the temple and a second on the left of the temple recite the incantation ' Butting storms' and the rest of the mašmaššu-priests recite the incantation ' Evil udug-demons'. They adjure them with incantation formulas.
On the next day you throw the magic circle, purification wipings and altar into a watercourse.
Alternatively, on the day of the eclipse of the moon the šangû-priests of the temples of the gods of Tirana lay out an altar at the gate of the temple of their gods.
They kindle a light. They cry out ' May confinement, murder, rebellion and the eclipse not come close to Uruk, Reš, Irigal, Baramah, Eana and the temples of the gods of Tirana'.
They raise their voice on account of lamentation. Until the eclipse becomes clear they cry out.
On the day of the eclipse of the moon they carry the bronze halhallatu-drum, the bronze manzû-drum (and) the bronze kettledrum from the storehouse and place (them) at the dais of the balangu-drum. As soon as the eclipse of the moon begins, kalû-priests, clothed in a linen garment, their heads covered with their torn pieces of cloth, raise lamentation, wailing and weeping to Sin during the eclipse. You lay down 3 heaps of flour opposite the kettledrum inside a magic circle.
You set up one offering vessel (full) of tears from a purified tamarisk and water on the right side of the 3 heaps of flour inside the magic circle, for the fixed procedure (relating) to the kalû-priests opposite Sin during the eclipse.
If a third visible surface (is) the extent of the eclipse, ' The wild bull in his fold' is performed. ' Rain-storms consuming life' penetrates into the heart.
The Emesal cult lament (is) ' Alas, he is the one who has destroyed my Abzu'. :
If two-thirds of the visible surface (is) the extent of the eclipse, ' The wild bull in his fold' (and) ' Woe, alas, your heart' are performed, and ' Alas, he is the one who has destroyed my Abzu' (and) ' Rain-storms consuming life' penetrate into the heart.
If a small totality (is) the extent of the eclipse, ' The wild bull in his fold' (and) ... are performed.
' Woe, alas, your heart' .... ..., '... in his fold' (and) ' Of heaven ...' ....

(Anšar replying:) '..., knowing all ...,

' Keep having ... driven very quickly,

The lord ... at his father's words,

'... I (am to be) your avenger,
'... I am to save your lives,
'... make supreme (and) name ...!'
... lord of wisdom, thoughtful god, ... calming ....
... lord of wisdom, thoughtful god, ... calming (by) daytime.
... his fury is a storm, a deserted land; (yet) ... his strength is sweet (like) a morning breeze.
His anger (has) no equal, his turmoil is flood; (yet) his heart is favourable, his mind is merciful.
The weight of whose hand the heavens can not bear; (even if) his gentle palm helps the dead.
Marduk, the weight of whose hand the heavens can not bear; (even if) his gentle palm helps the dead.
In (his) rage, graves are exposed then he (also) raises the fallen one from the disaster.
He frowns and (both) the tutelary deity and the protective deity abandon (the man); he gazes and his (personal) god returns to the one whom he pushed away.
His punishment is forthwith dangerous ...; (yet) he is merciful, and quickly becomes like a mother.
He hurries to care for his beloved, and, like a cow (for its) calf, he searches out after him constantly.
His beatings are barbed: they pierce the body; (yet) his bandages are soothing: they heal death (lit. fate).
When he speaks, he endows (people) with sin; (yet) on his day of justice, obligations and faults are absolved.
It is he who afflicts (people) with the utukku-demon of shivering; he, with his spells, (who) drives off chills and terror.
He is the one who reduces Adad's storm and Erra's blow.
He is the one who reconciles the infuriated gods (and) ....
He is the lord (who) oversees ... of the gods.
There is none ... whose behaviour he does not know.
Marduk oversees everything in the god's heart.
No other god comprehends his intention.
His heart is as merciful as his hand is heavy.
His mind is as healing as his weapons are murderous.
(For) the one who (is) against his will, who may cool down his blow?
Without his will, which ... may become light?
Let me proclaim his fury, (me) who ate ... like a fish.
Quickly, he is favourable to me as he heals ....
Let me teach the people ... is close.
His favourable understanding ... the fault.
From the days Bel ... ... ... and the hero Marduk ..., my (own) god rejected me; my (own) goddess became inactive ... the protective deity of welfare ...; my (own) tutelary deity ....
My rank ...
... have been laid upon me.
I was expelled (from) my house ...;
My omens are obscure ...;
signs of the diviner and ... ...;
... the rumour of the street ... ....
(When) I sleep at night ....
(As for) the king, flesh of the god ... he binds his heart .... ### I wonder if it would be better to correct the scribal mistake in translation and suggests "his heart has been bound" according to the other versions? (and put a note to explain)
The attendants ... denigrating talk ...; they are gathering together ....
If the first one (says): " His life ...", the second says: " I will remove ...";
thus the third: "... his appointment";
the fourth ... " I will enter his house";
the fifth is inciting fifty (against me);
... and the seventh will follow like his protective deity.
They have gathered around me; their band is a knot of seven.
As merciless as a storm, similar to utukku-demons ...
... their flesh is one and they are (all) set with (one) mouth.
They have become wild and they are burning like fire.
They persuaded ... (and) obstacles against me.
They ... my noble mouth as with a bridle.
My lips that had prattled ....
My sonorous roarings ... silently.
(Once) so high, my head bowed down ....
My heart, (once) so steady, ... in terror.
(Once) so wide, my chest ... the youngest.
My arms, (once) far-reaching, are (now) covered ....
I, who had gone about like a lord ....
I had been splendid but I turned ....

I go along the street ....
I enter the palace ....
My city ... like my enemy.
As if it were hostile ....

... ... ...
... place me (as) its (own) flesh ...
For the one who speaks kindly of me, ... will open for him; the eloquent one who slanders at me will be placed ....
As for the one who talks (with) maliciousness of me, the god is his helper.
The one who says: " It is enough!", his haste ....
(For) the one who does not help, life becomes like (that of) a protective deity.
I have neither acquired someone at my side, nor seen a merciful one.
To the riffraff, they distribute all that was mine.
They have blocked up the mouth of my canal with silt.
In my meadows, they have driven away the work song.
Like the city of my enemy, they put silence (upon my) my city.
They let another take my office and they appointed a stranger for my rites.
Days of depression;, nights of wailing; months of anxious silence, years of misery.
All day long, I indeed moaned like a dove. Like a singer I made the lamentations loud. ## I would prefer to translate by "my lamentations resound like (those) of a singer", but it might be too far from akkadian.
My eyes were always bursting into tears; my cheeks were burning with tears as if I was trampled. ## Lit. "like a trampled one" but I'm not sure it would be understandable in English.
Fear in my heart has turned my face black; terror and panic have turned my skin pallid.
... of my heart have shaken in constant trembling.
... and like a burning fire.
Words of my prayer ... ... ... ? ever-ignited? .
... ... my supplication was strife.
... my words were as difficult as the dark.
I speak ... (but) my conversation is an obstacle.
As if, in daytime, good fortune will come straight to me, the moon will appear (and) my sun will shine.

The Leopard is dark (means) the Moon will undergo an eclipse in the evening watch. The Swallow is dark (means) the Moon will undergo an eclipse in the middle watch.
Gula is dark (means) the Moon will undergo an eclipse in the dawn watch. All constellations, ditto. The Crab (gloss: break)
planet ... (gloss: break) (gloss: break) ... (gloss: break) they approach. Ištar of the stars; alternatively, Belet-ili, approaches Šulpae.
For all of its life it makes meteors and comets. Alternatively, the moon appears in Tašritu (Month VII) and approaches the Crab.
The Bristle reaches the Yoke. The Bristle of day 1 ( is) the Yoke. The Bull of Heaven that appeared on day 1 does not appear ( again) until day 20.
Of Ayyaru (Month II), the Bristle. Of Simanu (Month III), the Raven. Of Duʾuzu (Month IV), the Arrow. Of Anu (Month V), the Wagon. Of Ululu (Month VI), the Eagle. Of Tašritu (Month VII), the Dog.
Of Arahsamnu (Month VIII), the Scorpion. Of Kislimu (Month IX), the Barge. Of Ṭebetu (Month X), Mars. Of Šabaṭu (Month XI), the Vole. Of Addaru (Month XII), the Field. This (with) the Bristle, of all months (means) stroke of lightning.
You make a prediction. If the Bristle is above the planet: the stroke of lightning will devastate. If it is below (the planet): it will be harmless.
Alternatively, the Field is dark. The Field appears in Nisannu (Month I). Now, until Ayyaru (Month II) it does not appear, meaning its eclipse and the constellations ditto (do not appear either). In an intercalary month, he has predicted an eclipse concerning it.
.... It does not beat Haniš (and) Šullat. It is the pirdu of the eclipse. On account of that, a land will be abandoned and a land will be settled. In Nisannu it undergoes an eclipse. In 18 years, it returns to Ayyaru.
In 96 years, Nisannu is (again) Nisannu. That man does work (but) matters are not finished. You add on top the 12 (years) of the White Star (Jupiter), and in 1 48 years it is all finished. He does great work.
The pirdu of an eclipse. When Marduk performed the procedure, the enemy was overthrown. It is said concerning all settings of the Sun.
If on day 1 of Nisannu (Month I) Jupiter set with the Moon, (and) on day 12 an eclipse of the Moon took place: the king -- as they say in the Series (Enūma Anu Ellil) -- the king will die on day 20.
Day 20 (is) day 12. In 12 days after the eclipse, the king will die. Of Abu (Month V)and Kislimu (Month IX), ditto. Day 1 (and) day 13 are written because of day 2 of Ayyaru (Month II).
For Venus, ditto. Of Mercury, Saturn, and Mars, ditto.
(If) in Tašritu (Month VII) on day 14, the Moon undergoes an eclipse in the Hireling during the evening watch (and) the White Star (Jupiter) and Saturn are in the Hireling, the Lion, Pabilsag, or the Scales -- the opposite of the Hireling -- you tighten a straight string. It stands there and .... You observe Mercury's place in the zodiacal signs.
(If) Mercury stands (there) and is faint: light rain. When Mercury is bright, heavy rain. (If) Venus is faint inside it: a flood will flow. (If) Venus is bright inside it: an enemy attack will become weak; abundance. In the the evening watch, the middle watch, the dawn watch, for all the constellations it is the same.
When the Moon undergoes an eclipse, observe the culminating stars. On the day of the Sun predict an interpretation concerning the land.
(If) a 2nd eclipse appears, then to make your string, one-third of the night-time ( is) one-third of the daytime. In the month of your eclipse and in your 18(th preceding year), (the eclipse took place) 1;30° after sunrise. A third of the day of your 18(th preceding year) is 1°. You add 1° to 1;30° and (it is) 2;30°. Add 1°, the period of visibility, on top and (it is) 3;30°. You subtract from it 3, the (length of) daytime of Nisannu, and 0;30° is remaining. You say (this is) after sunset.
If in your 18(th preceding year), in Nisannu, the month of your eclipse, the after sunset was 1;30°: one-third of the night-time of Nisannu is 1°. You subtract (the 1;30°) from 3°, the night-time of Nisannu, and you say of the remaining 1;30°, " after sunrise".
If in your 18(th preceding year), in Nisannu, 0;30° was for the setting of the sun: one-third of 3°, the daytime of Nisannu, is 1°. You add 1°, the period of visibility, on top and (it is) 2°. : You subtract 0;30° from 2° and 1;30° is remaining. You say (it is) " after sunset".
If in your 18(th preceding year), in Nisannu, it was 30° of night-time until day break: one-third of 3°, the night-time of Nisannu, is 1°. You add 1°, the period of visibility, on top and (it is) 2°. : You subtract 0;30° from 2° and 1;30° is remaining. You say (it is) " after sunrise".
One-third, two-thirds : totality, totality they say. Two-thirds, one third: favourable day, favourable day, they say.
For you to foresee a hollow or full (month). If in the 18(th preceding year) Nisannu (began on day) 1 (and) an addition was not added to it: Ayyaru, which is after it, is full. One-third of moonset-to-sunrise and sunrise-to-moonset is 6. You subtract that from sunrise-to-moonset of day 1 of Ayyaru, and (if) it is less than (in) Nisannu that was before it, Ayyaru of your new year will be full.
As many (months) as were full in your 18(th preceding year) and to which an addition had not been added and a subtraction subtracted from it, and which were less than the month before it: you predict (them) as full (in the coming year).
If in your 18(th preceding year) it (the month) was full, an addition had not been added to it and a subtraction was subtracted from it and it was less than 10 degrees: you predict (it) as full (in the coming year).
If in your 18(th preceding year) it (the month) was full and an addition had been added to it: you predict (it) as hollow.
If the Moon is high to the Sun: hollow. The days (of first moonset after sunrise) are 15th days. If the Moon is low to the Sun: full. The days are 13th days. If the Moon reaches maximum latitude: the days are 15th days (and) 16th days. If it reaches minimum latitude, the days are 12th days (and) 13th days. Nisannu .....
If the Moon takes a path of maximum latitude: 3 (months) will be hollow. If it takes a path of minimum latitude: 3 (months) will be full. From Nisannu the 1st days (of the month) will be high, the 14th days low. From Tašritu (Month VII) the 1st days will be low, the 14th days high.
For you to work out the equivalent of 36 (years). From Nisannu (Month I) of the 36(th year) you go back 6 months, Nisannu, and you write 0;40 of the moonset-to-sunrise and sunrise-to-moonset of Tašritu, and you subtract (it) from the sunrise-to-moonset of day 1 of Nisannu of the 36(th year); and if it extends beyond 10°, you add the entire moonset-to-sunrise and sunrise-to-moonset on top.
Otherwise, you subtract 0;40 of the moonset-to-sunrise and sunrise-to-moonset from the sunrise-to-moonset of the middle of the month. You subtract 0;40 of the moonrise-to-sunset and sunset-to-moonrise from the sunset-to-moonrise.
You go back 6 months and you examine the sunrise-to-moonset of before the Sun for Tašritu (Month VII) and Arahsamnu (Month VIII). If the sunrise-to-moonset of Arahsamnu is 6 and the sunrise-to-moonset of Tašritu is 3, you subtract 3, by which the sunrise-to-moonset of Tašritu is smaller than that of Arahsamnu, from the sunrise-to-moonset of day 1 of Nisannu (Month I) of your new year; and (if) it is greater than 12°, you predict Ayyaru (Month II), which is after it, as hollow.
If the sunrise-to-moonset of Arahsamnu is 3 and the sunrise-to-moonset of Tašritu is 6, you add 3, by which the sunrise-to-moonset of Tašritu is greater than that of Arahsamnu, to the sunrise-to-moonset of day 1 of Nisannu of your new year; and if it is greater than that of Nisannu of your new year, full; if less, hollow.
From Nisannu (Month I) of your new year you go back 18 (years) and you examine the weight of the daytime and night-time of Nisannu of your 18(th previous year).
If in Nisannu of your 18(th year) on day 15 the daytime is 6 double-hours and the night-time is 6 double-hours (and) from (day) 15 to 20 of Nisannu the daytime is 6 double-hours, 10°, the night-time is 5 5/6 double-hours: you subtract 5° 4 nindanu from the sunrise-to-moonset of day 1 of Ayyaru of your 18(th year); and if it is greater than 12°, ḫollow; if less, Ayyaru of your new year is full.
For you to work out the equivalent of the day of the moon's disappearance. If in Nisannu (Month I) of your new year, on (day) 27, the moonrise-to-sunrise is 25, the daytime is 3;20, the night-time is 2;40: 3;20 times 4 is 13;20. You subtract 13;20 from 25 and (the moon) will be late (by) 11;40. On (day) 28, 11;40 is remaining for the Sun.
You subtract 13;20 from 11;40 and on day 29 the Moon will have passed the Sun by 1;40. You add 13;20 on top of 1;40 and (it is) 15. On day 30, the Moon will have passed the Sun by 15.
If on (day) 27 the moonrise-to-sunrise is 15, 3;20 times 4 is 13;20. You subtract 13;20 from 15 and (the Moon) will be late (by) 1;40. On (day) 28 1;40 is remaining for the Sun. You subtract 1;40 from 13;20 and on day 29 (the Moon) will have passed the Sun by 11;40.
If on (day) 27 the moonrise-to-sunrise is 24, the daytime is 4, the night-time 2: 4 times 4 is 16. You subtract 16 from 24 and (the Moon) will be late (by) 8. On (day) 28, 8 will be remaining for the Sun. You subtract 16 from 8 and on (day) 29 (the Moon) will have passed the Sun by 8.
Half of 16 is 8. You add on top of 8 and (it is) 16. On (day) 29, at the setting of the Sun, the sunrise-to-moonset is 16. If the daytime is longer than the night-time, you multiply the daytime by 4. If the night-time is longer than the daytime, you multiply the night-time by 4. You examine the weight of daytime and night-time and you take the path with the excess.
For you to foresee the equivalent of the month. In Duʾuzu (Month IV) on day 1 the sunrise-to-moonset is 20. You add 7 to 20 and (it is) 27. 20 times 27 is 9. You add 9 to 20 and it is 29.
You write its 1/2 and (it is) 14;30. Abu (Month V) is hollow. If 14;30 is smaller than the sunrise-to-moonset, hollow; if greater, full. (Anything) above 25 you put to the sides. If it is less than 25 you add all. For all months, ditto.
Alternatively, you multiply the sunrise-to-moonset of day 1 by 20 and ditto. Alternatively, if full you add 6; if hollow, 12.
For you to foresee 12, the sunrise-to-moonset. You observe the day of the moon's disappearance of Addaru (Month XII) that was before the Nisannu (Month I) of your (just) completed year.
If it is greater than the day of the moon's disappearance of Addaru that was before the Nisannu of your new year, you subtract whatever is greater from the sunrise-to-moonset of the Nisannu of your new year; and you predict that Nisannu will be full.
If it is smaller, you add whatever is smaller to the sunrise-to-moonset of the Nisannu of your new year; and you predict that Nisannu will be hollow.
For you to work out rain and flood. 1 12 is for Jupiter. 1 sixty, 4; alternatively, 16, is for Venus. 46; alternatively 13, is for Mercury. 59 is for Saturn. 1 19; alternatively, 47, is for Mars.
For you to work out rain and flood. You turn back behind you one-fifth of 9 sixties, 9 × 3600, and 10 30 of (gloss: break) of Saturn you turn back.
You put behind you 40 years of Venus, 30 of Mercury, and (there will be) regular flooding. Alternatively, to work out rain. You add 30 years of Saturn, 41 years of Jupiter, ... 1 23 ... (gloss: break). There and then, in these months, rain will fall from the skies.
In 1 12 years a comet which appeared in the Tails will appear (again) in the Tails. In 36 years it will answer.
In 21 years rain will answer rain, flood (will answer) flood. In 21 years earthquake will answer earthquake. In 6 hundred 54 years (gloss: break).

(If) the Yoke puts its face towards sunset when it emerges, and the west wind arises then turns to the south: in Ululu (VII), on the 10th day, ruination of the land will be brought about.
(If) the Yoke puts it face towards sunset when it emerges and faces the front of heaven: hunger will be brought about. Reign of annihilation of Ibbi-Suen, king of Ur, who went in bondage to Anšan. After him his troops weep. Ditto (after him his troops) fall.
If a man is pronounced for rulership and the south wind blows: that man will prosper.

If a man is pronounced for rulership and the east wind blows: his days will be short.
If a man is pronounced for rulership and the west wind blows: he will not thrive.

Antiochus, great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Babylon, king of the lands, provider for Esagil and Ezida, foremost heir of king Seleucus, the Macedonian, king of Babylon, am I.
When I decided to (re)build Esagil and Ezida, I moulded the bricks of Esagil and Ezida in the land of Hatti (= Syria) with my pure hands, using the finest oil, and for the laying of the foundations of Esagil and Ezida I brought them.
In the month of Addaru, on the twentieth day, in year 43 (= 27 March 268 BC), I laid the foundations of Ezida, the true house, the temple of Nabû which is in Borsippa.
Nabû, supreme heir, wisest of the gods, the proud one, who is worthy of praise, firstborn son of Marduk, offspring of Erua the queen who forms living creatures, look favourably (upon me).
At your supreme command, whose command is unalterable, may the downfall of the land of my foe, the achievement of my successes, triumphant victory over my enemies, a just rule, a prosperous reign, years of happiness and the full enjoyment of great old age, be a gift for the kingship of Antiochus and king Seleucus, his son, forever.
Son of the prince, Nabû, heir of Esagil, firstborn son of Marduk, offspring of Erua the queen, when with rejoicing and jubilation you enter Ezida, the true house, the house of your supreme divinity, at your true command, which cannot be annulled, may my days be long, my years many; may my throne be secure, my reign lengthy, on your exalted tablet which preserves the boundary of heaven and earth.
In your pure mouth may my good fortune be constantly established.
May I conquer the lands from the rising to the setting of the sun; may my hands inventory their tribute and may I bring it to perfect Esagil and Ezida.
Nabû, supreme heir, upon your entry to Ezida, the true house, may the good fortune of Antiochus, king of the lands, king Seleucus, his son, and Stratonike, his consort, the queen, be established in your mouth.
Anu-uballiṭ, whose second name is Kephalon, son of Anu-balassu-iqbi, rab ša rēš āli of Uruk: # check that title! Clancier says "chief of the clergy"; literally "overseer of the city eunuchs of Uruk"; CAD hedges with "(an administrator in the temple)"
Enamena, the cella of Anu, and Egašanana, the shrine of Antu, of the Reš temple that previously Oannes ... had built, had become dilapidated, so
I destroyed (it) and on Nisannu (Month I)/Abu (Month V) day 2 of year 110 (SE), for the sake of the life of Antiochus, king of the lands, my lord, I widened its ancient foundations and I applied gypsum (plaster) to them.
I built and I completed the interior.
I brought cedars from Mahdaru, the strong mountain, and I roofed (with) them.
I installed strong cedar doors at the gates of their cellas.
Nisannu, year sixty-8, Seleucus was king. Anu-uballiṭ, son of Anu-ikṣur, descendant of Ahʾutu, governor of Uruk, to whom Antiochus king of the lands gave the second name Nikarchus:
The Reš temple, temple of Anu and Antu: the Lofty Gate, the great gate, socle of Papsukkal, entrance to the Reš temple; the Great Gate, socle of Nusku, entrance gate -- 2 gates that open on the south side --
(and) the Gate of Plenty, gate that allows the bounty of the land to enter: total 3 gates that open onto the outside, 7 courtyards are located next to the courtyard of the Dais of Destinies;
The enclosure wall of the Reš temple, the service buildings, the shrines of the great gods and their courtyards -- he built and completed.
He built the doors of sweet, fragrant wood and installed them in their frames. He surrounded the temple with a parapet.
He built a gold bolt (and) a gold crown and they were installed at the Lofty Gate facing outwards.
He built and completed (all this) for the life of Antiochus and Seleucus the kings.
On the 8th day of Nisannu (Month I) Anu and Antu entered and occupied their seats in Namena, the shrine, for eternity. He established regular ginû-offerings and sattukku-offerings in it (the shrine), as formerly.
