Upaš of (the land Bīt)-Kapsi (lit. “son of Kapsi”) assembled his people and ascended Mount Abirus. I pursued him, defeated him, (and) carried off his booty.

On my return, Iransu (Iranzu) of the land Mannea heard about the heroic deeds of (the god) Aššur, my lord, that I had done again and again to all of the city rulers of the mountain regions, and terror came over him. He came to the city Sumbi, which is next to Assyria, before me, and kissed my feet.

Between the lands Kištan and Ḫalpi, districts of the land Kummuḫu, they trusted in one another’s strength and drew up a battle array.
I marched for a distance of seven leagues, day and night, and I did not allow the troops of Assyria to rest, did not give (them) water to drink, (and) did not pitch camp nor bivouac (i 30´) my soldiers (allowing them to recover from) their weariness. I fought with them, defeated them, (and) took their camp(s) away from them.

I increased the territory of Assyria by taking hold of (foreign) lands (and) added countless people to its population. I constantly shepherd them in safe pastures.
I, Tiglath-pileser (III), king of Assyria, who personally conquered all of the lands from east to west (lit. “from sunrise to sunset”), (ii 20´) appointed governors in places where the chariots of the kings, my ancestors, never crossed over. I marched about from the Great Sea of the Rising Sun to the cities Rēši-ṣūri (and) Byblos on the shore of the Great Sea of the Setting Sun, and (thus) I exercised authority over the (four) quarters (of the world).
In my ninth palû, I ordered (my troops) to march against the Medes. I conquered the cities of city rulers who were unsubmissive. I defeated them (and) carried off their booty. I firmly placed my steles in ..., the city Bīt-Ištar, the city Ṣibar (Ṣibur), (and at) Mount Ariarma (and) Mount Silḫazu, mighty mountains. I received payment from those who did submit:

I had a stele made in the vicinity of the mountains. I depicted on it (symbols of) the great gods, my lords, (and) I fashioned my royal image on it. I inscribed on it the mighty deeds of (the god) Aššur, my lord, and my personal achievements (iii 35) < that> I accomplished again and again throughout (all of) the lands. ... on the border which ... ...

I smashed the land Bīt-Šilāni in its entirety like a pot. I destroyed the city Sarrabānu, its (text: “their”) great royal city, (making it) like a tell after the Deluge and I plundered it.

To Tiglath-pileser, ... magnificent king of the lands, ...:
Kīdītê, provincial governor of ... and of (the city) Arrapha ..., protégé of Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, (...) ... for the palace of joy ... ... ... dedicated/built.
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of Assyria, unrivalled king, pious shepherd who reveres the great gods, guardian of truth who loves justice, renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (and) strives after good deeds, perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning:
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises.
At the beginning of my kingship, after I sat on the (lordly) throne and took command of the population of Assyria amid obedience and peace, Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), an evil foe, a rebel (with) a treacherous mind, an evildoer whose villainous acts are true, sought frie ndship with Šutur-Naḫundu (Šutruk-Naḫḫunte II), an Elamite, by presenting him with gold, silver, (and) precious stones; then, he continuously requested reinforcements.
To the land of Sumer and Akkad, he (Šutur-Naḫundu) sent to his (Marduk-apla-iddina’s) assistance Imbappa, his field marshal, together with the massed body of his troops, Tannānu, (his) third man, ten unit commanders, including Nergal-nāṣir, a Sutian who is fearless in battle, 80,000 archers (and) lancers, (and) the 850 wagons (and) horses that were with them.
Moreover, he, the evil Chaldean, evildoer, (and) offspring of murder, gathered together Uruk, Larsa, Ur, Eridu, Kulaba, Kissik, (and) Nēmed-Laguda, the lands of the Bīt-Yakīn, Bīt-Amukāni, Bīt-Ašillāni (Bīt-Šillāni), Bīt-Saʾalli, (and) Bīt-Dakkūri, all of the Chaldeans, as many as there were; on the bank(s) of the Tigris River, the Tuʾumuna, Riḫiḫu, Yadaqqu, Gibrê, (and) Maliḫu (Malaḫu); on the bank(s) of the Surappu River, the Gurumu, Ubulu, Damunu, Gambulu, Hindaru, Ruʾuʾa, (and) Puqudu; on the bank(s) of the Euphrates River, the Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu — insubmissive Arameans who did not know (fear of) death; (15) Nippur, Dilbat, Marad, Kish, Ḫursagkalama, Babylon, Borsippa, (and) Cutha, all of Karduniaš (Babylonia) and prepared (them) for battle.
When they reported his (Marduk-apla-iddina’s) evil deeds to me, Sennacherib, the attentive man of the steppe, I raged up like a lion and ordered the march into Babylon to confront him. He (Marduk-apla-iddina), the (very) image of an evil gallû-demon, heard about the advance of my expeditionary force, then he reinforced their companies with horses (and) Elamite, Aramean, (and) Chaldean archers, together with Nergal-nāṣir and ten unit commanders of the king of the land Elam who did not know (fear of) death, (and) the countless forces who were with them. He brought their contingents together in Cutha and had (them) keep watch at outposts for the approach of my expeditionary force.
I put my yoked teams in order. On the twentieth day of the month Šabāṭu (XI), like a powerful wild ox, I took the lead of my troops from Baltil (Aššur), but I did not wait for the main force of my army, nor did I wait for the rear guard. (20) I sent (my) chief eunuch (and) my provincial governors to Kish ahead of me, (saying): “Take the road to Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), but do not be careless about putting a strong watch on him!”
He (Marduk-apla-iddina) saw my provincial governors, then came out of the Zababa Gate with all of his forces and did battle with my magnates in the plain of Kish. The enemy prevailed over my magnates in the thick of battle and they (my magnates) were unable to withstand him. They sent their messenger to me in the plain of Cutha for help.
In my rage, I unleashed a fierce assault on Cutha, then I slaughtered the warriors surrounding its wall like sheep and took possession of the city. I brought out horses, the Elamite, Aramean, (and) Chaldean archers, the Elamite unit commanders, and Nergal-nāṣir, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.
I raged up like a lion and became furious like the Deluge. With my merciless warriors, I set out for Kish against Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan). Moreover, he, (that) evildoer, saw the cloud of dust of my expeditionary force from afar and fear fell upon him. He abandoned all of his forces and fled to the land Guzummānu.
I defeated Tannānu, together with the Elamite, Chaldean, and Aramean troops who had stood by him and had come to his aid, and I scattered his forces. I captured alive Adinu, a nephew of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), together with Basqānu, a brother of Iatiʾe, queen of the Arabs, along with their troops. I seized the chariots, wagons, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, (and) Bactrian camels that he had abandoned during the battle.
With a rejoicing heart and a radiant face, I rushed to Babylon and entered the palace of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan) to take charge of the possessions and property therein. I opened his treasury and brought out gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, precious stones, beds, armchairs, a processional carriage, royal paraphernalia of his with gold (and) silver mountings, all kinds of possessions (and) property without number, a substantial treasure, (together with) his wife, his palace women, female stewards, eunuchs, courtiers, attendants, male singers, female singers, palace servants who cheered up his princely mind, all of the craftsmen, as many as there were, (and) his palace attendants, and I counted (them) as booty.
I hastened after him to the land Guzummānu and ordered my warriors into the midst of swamps and marshes. For five days they sought him out, but his (hiding) place could not be found. (35) I gathered together the rest of his horses (and) troops, who were weary (and) who had fled like deer instead of going with him, from the midst of the open country and plain.
In the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Amatu, Ḫauae, Supapu, Nuqabu, Bīt-Sannabi, Qudayyin, Kidrina, Dūr-Ladini, Bitāti, (and) Bānītu, the land Guzummānu, the cities Dūr-Yanṣuri, Dūr-Abī-Yataʾ, Dūr-Rudumme, Bīt-Raḫê, Ḫapiša, Sadian, Ḫurudu, Ṣaḫrina, Iltuk, Allallu, Marad, Yaqimuna, Kupruna, Bīt-Kudurri, Sūqa-Marusi, altogether 33 fortified cities, fortresses of the land of the Bīt-Dakkūri, together with 250 small(er) settlements in their environs;
the cities Dūr-Appê, Dūr-Tanê, Dūr-Samaʾ, Sarrabātu, Ṣalaḫatu, Dūr-Abdāya, Sappi-ḫimari, Ṣibtu-ša-Makkamê, altogether 8 fortified cities, fortresses of the land of the Bīt-Saʾalli, together with 120 small(er) settlements in their environs;
the cities Sapīya (Šapīya), Sarrabānu, Larak, Parak-Marri, Bīt-Ilu-bāni, Aḫudu, Ša-iṣṣur-Adad, Šaḫarratu, Manaḫḫu, Ša-amēlê, Dūr-Aqqīya, Nagītu, Nūr-abīnu, Ḫar-Ṣuarra, Dūr-Rukbi, Danda-Ḫulla, Dūr-Bir-Dada, Bīt-Reʾê, Dūr-Ugurri, Ḫindaina, Dūr-Uayyit, Bīt-Taurâ, Sapḫuna, Bu-ḫarru, (45) Ḫarbat-Iddina, Ḫarbat-Kalbi, Ša-barê, Bīt-Bāni-ilūya, Sulādu, Bīt-Iltama-samaʾa, Bīt-Dīni-ili, Daqala, Ḫameza, Bēlā, Tairu, Kiprānu, Iltaratu, Aqqar-ša-kīna, Sagabatu-ša-Mardukīya, altogether 39 fortified cities of the land of the Bīt-Amukāni, together with 350 small(er) settlements in their environs;
(and) the cities Bīt-Zabidīya, Larsa, Kulaba, Eridu, Kissik, Nēmed-Laguda, (and) Dūr-Yakīn, including the city Kār-Nabû, which is on the shore of the Bitter Sea, altogether 8 fortified cities, fortresses of the land of the Bīt-Yakīn, together with 100 small(er) settlements in their environs;
the (grand) total is 88 fortified cities, fortresses of Chaldea, together with 820 small(er) settlements in their environs.
I let my troops eat the grain (and) dates in their gardens (and) their crops in the countryside. I destroyed (them), devastated (them), (and) burned (them) with fire, (and) turned (them) into forgotten ruin hills.
I brought out the auxiliary forces of the Arameans (and) Chaldeans who were in Uruk, Nippur, Kish, (and) Ḫursagkalama, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.
I let my army eat the grain (and) dates in their gardens, the fields they had labored in, (and) the crops in the countryside, which is their life’s necessity.
I appointed over them Bēl-ibni, a son of a rab banî (and) a scion of Šuanna (Babylon) who had grown up like a young puppy in my palace, as king of the land of Sumer and Akkad.
On my return march, I defeated all together the Tuʾumuna, Riḫiḫu, Yadaqqu, Ubudu, Gibrê, Maliḫu (Malaḫu), Gurumu, Ubulu, Damunu, Gambulu, Ḫindaru, Ruʾuʾa, Puqudu, Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu, insubmissive Arameans and I plundered them.
In the course of my campaign, I received a substantial payment from Nabû-bēl-šumāti, the official in charge of the city Ḫararatu: gold, silver, large mu sukkannu-trees, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats.
I put to the sword the population of the city Ḫirimmu, a dangerous enemy who since time immemorial had not submitted to the kings, my ancestors, and I did not leave one alive. I reorganized that district (and) imposed for eternity one ox, ten sheep, ten homers of wine, (and) twenty homers of dates as his first-fruits offerings for the ginû-offerings to the gods of Assyria, my lords.
I returned safely to Assyria with 208,000 substantial captives, 7,200 horses (and) mules, 11,073 donkeys, 5,230 camels, 80,050 oxen, (and) 800,100 sheep and goats. This is apart from the people, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats that all of my troops had carried away and appropriated for themselves.
Moreover, I put to the sword the soldiers of the enemy, a recalcitrant force who had not submitted to my yoke, and hung (their corpses) on poles.
At that time, Nineveh, the exalted cult center, the city loved by the goddess Ištar in which all of the rituals for gods and goddesses are present; the enduring foundation (and) eternal base whose plan had been designed by the stars (lit. “writing”) of the firmament and whose arrangement was made manifest since time immemorial; (65) a sophisticated place (and) site of secret lore in which every kind of skilled craftsmanship, all of the rituals, (and) the secret(s) of the lalgar (cosmic subterranean water) are apprehended;
in which since time immemorial earlier kings, my ancestors, before me exercised dominion over Assyria and ruled the subjects of the god Enlil, and wherein annually, without interruption, they received an income unsurpassed in amount, the tribute of the rulers of the four quarters (of the world);
(but) not one among them had paid heed to (or) shown interest in the palace inside it, the seat of lordly dwelling whose site had become too small; nor had anyone (of them) conceived of and put his mind towards the straightening of the city’s street(s) and the widening of (its) squares, the dredging of the river, (and) the planting of orchards:
(But) as for me, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, the performing of this work came to my attention by the will of the gods and I put my mind to it. I forcibly removed the people of Chaldea, Aramean (tribes), the land of the Manneans, (and) the lands Que and Ḫilakku, who had not submitted to my yoke, then I made them carry baskets (of earth) and they made bricks. I cut down canebrakes in Chaldea and I had their splendid reeds hauled (to Nineveh) for its (the palace’s) construction by enemy soldiers whom I had defeated.
The former palace, whose longer side was thirty nindanu and whose shorter side was ten nindanu, which earlier kings, my ancestors, had had constructed, but whose construction they had carried out inexpertly, (and) alongside of which the Tebilti River had flowed from distant days, caused erosion in its foundations, (and) shaken its base:
I tore down that small palace in its entirety and improved the course of the Tebilti River and directed its outflow.
In a propitious month, on a favorable day, in the hidden depths of its subterranean waters I bonded together strong mountain stone sixty (nindanu) along (its) longer side (and) thirty-four (nindanu) along (its) shorter side, then I raised (that) area out of the water and converted (it) to dry land. In order to prevent its foundation from being weakened over the passage of time by cresting flood(s), I surrounded its damp course with large limestone slabs (and thereby) reinforced its base. Upon them, I filled in a terrace to a height of 160 courses of brick, then added (it) to the dimensions of the former palace and (thus) enlarged its structure.
I had a palace of elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, cypress, juniper, and terebinth, (a palace that I named) Egalzagdunutukua (“The Palace Without a Rival”), constructed thereon as my royal residence.
I roofed them (the rooms of the palace) with beams of cedar grown on Mount Amanus, which were brought with difficulty from (that) distant mountain terrain. I fastened bands of shining bronze on magnificent doors of cypress, whose scent is sweet on opening and closing, and I installed (them) in their gates.
For my lordly pleasure, I had a portico, a replica of a Hittite palace, which is called bīt-ḫilāni in the language of the land Amurru, constructed inside them.
Eight striding lions, standing opposite one another, which were made from 11,400 talents of shining copper, cast by the god Ninagal, (and) were filled with radiance — upon (those) lion colossi I installed two identical columns that were cast from 6,000 talents of bronze, together with two large cedar columns, and I positioned cross-beams (upon them) as a cornice for their gate(s).
I expertly fashioned four mountain sheep colossi of silver (and) bronze, together with mountain sheep colossi of massive mountain stone, and in four directions I had (them) hold their (the gates’) suitable door bolt(s).
I engraved on large limestone slabs (images of) the enemy settlements that I had conquered. I surrounded their (the palace rooms’) lower courses (with them and) made (them) an object of wonder.
I planted alongside it (the palace) a botanical garden, a replica of Mount Amanus, which has all kinds of aromatic plants (and) fruit trees, trees that are the mainstay of the mountains and Chaldea, collected inside it.
To plant gardens, I subdivided the meadowland upstream of the city into plots of two pānu each for the citizens of Nineveh and I handed (them) over to them.
To make (those) planted areas luxuriant, I cut with iron picks a canal straight through mountain and valley, from the border of the city Kisiru to the plain of Nineveh. (90) I caused an inexhaustible supply of water to flow there for a distance of one and a half leagues from the Ḫusur River (and) made (it) gush through feeder canals into those gardens.
After I had finished the work on my lordly palace, broadened the squares, (and) brought light into the alleys (and) streets, making (them) as bright as day, I invited inside it (the palace) the god Aššur, the great lord, (and) the gods and goddesses living in Assyria, then I made splendid offerings and presented my gift(s).
In the future, may one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur names for shepherding the land and people, renovate its dilapidated section(s) when that palace becomes old and dilapidated. May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Aššur will (then) hear his prayers.

Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of Assyria, unrivalled king, pious shepherd who reveres the great gods, guardian of truth who loves justice, renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (and) strives after good deeds, perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning:
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises.
At the beginning of my kingship, I brought about the defeat of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), together with the troops of (the land) Elam, his allies, in the plain of Kish. In the midst of that battle he abandoned his camp. He fled alone and escaped to the land Guzummānu, (where) he entered the swamps and marshes and (thereby) saved his life. I seized the chariots, wagons, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, and Bactrian camels that he had abandoned in the thick of battle.
I joyfully entered his palace, which is in Babylon, then I opened his treasury and brought out gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, precious stones, all kinds of possessions (and) property, a substantial treasure, (together with) his wife, his palace women, courtiers, attendants, all of the craftsmen, as many as there were, (and) his palace attendants, and I counted (them) as booty.
I pursued him to the land Guzummānu and ordered my warriors into the midst of swamps and marshes. For five days they searched (for him), but his (hiding) place could not be found.
With the strength of the god Aššur, my lord, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered 89 fortified cities, fortresses of Chaldea, and 820 small(er) settlements in their environs. I brought out the auxiliary forces of the Arameans and Chaldeans who were in Uruk, Nippur, Kish, Ḫursagkalama, (and) Cutha, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.
I appointed over them Bēl-ibni, a son of a rab banî (and) a scion of Šuanna (Babylon) who had grown up like a young puppy in my palace, as king of the land of Sumer and Akkad.
On my return march, I defeated all together the Tuʾumuna, Riḫiḫu, Yadaqqu, Ubudu, Gibrê, Maliḫu (Malaḫu), Gurumu, Ubulu, Damunu, (15) Gambulu, Ḫindaru, Ruʾuʾa, Puqudu, Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu, insubmissive Arameans. I carried off into Assyria a substanial booty (consisting of) 208,000 people, male and female, 7,200 horses (and) mules, 11,073 donkeys, 5,230 camels, 80,100 oxen, (and) 800,600 sheep and goats.
In the course of my campaign, I received a substantial audience gift from Nabû-bēl-šumāti, the official in charge of the city Ḫararatu: gold, silver, large musukkannu-trees, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats.
I put to the sword the population of the city Ḫirimmu, a dangerous enemy who since time immemorial had not submitted to my yoke, and I did not leave one alive. I reorganized that district (and) imposed for eternity one ox, ten sheep, ten homers of wine, (and) twenty homers of dates as his first-fruits offerings to the gods of Assyria, my lords.
On my second campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and I marched to the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians, a dangerous enemy who since time immemorial had not submitted to the kings, my ancestors. In the high mountains, difficult terrain, I rode on horseback and had my personal chariot carried on (men’s) necks. In very rugged terrain I roamed about on foot like a wild bull.
I surrounded (and) conquered the city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ, their fortified city. I brought out of it people, young (and) old, horses, mules, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats, and I counted (them) as booty. I destroyed, devastated, (and) turned into ruins their small(er) settlements, which were without number. I burned with fire the pavilions (and) tents that they relied upon, and reduced (them) to ashes.
I made that city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ a fortress again (and) strengthened its enceinte more than before. I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. (25) I brought down from the mountains the people of the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians who had fled from my weapons and I made (them) dwell in the cities Ḫardišpu (and) Bīt-Kubatti. I placed them under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Arrapḫa. I had a stele made, had all the victorious conquests that I achieved over them written on it, and I erected (it) in (that) city.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Ellipi. Before my arrival, Ispabāra, their king, abandoned his fortified cities (and) his treasury and fled far away. I overwhelmed all of his wide land like a fog. I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Marʾubištu (and) Akkuddu, cities of his royal house, together with thirty-four fortified cities and small(er) settlements in their environs, which were without number, then I cut down their orchards (and) poured deathly quiet over their fertile fields. (In this manner) I reduced to desolation the land Ellipi to its full extent.
I carried off people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats without number and brought them to nought. I detached from his land the cities Ṣi(ṣ)ṣirtu (and) Kummaḫlum, fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements in their environs (and) the district of the land Bīt-Barrû in its entirety, and I added (this area) to the territory of Assyria.
I took the city Elenzaš as a royal city and a fortress for that district, then I changed its former name and called it Kār-Sennacherib.
On my return march, I received a substantial payment from the distant Medes, of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had heard mention. (Thus) I made them bow down to the yoke of my lordship.
At that time, Nineveh, the exalted cult center, the city loved by the goddess Ištar in which all of the rituals for gods and goddesses are present; (35) the enduring foundation (and) eternal base whose plan had been designed by the stars (lit. “writing”) of the firmament and whose arrangement was made manifest since time immemorial; a sophisticated place (and) site of secret lore in which every kind of skilled craftsmanship, all of the rituals, (and) the secret(s) of the lalgar (cosmic subterranean water) are apprehended;
in which since time immemorial earlier kings, my ancestors, before me exercised dominion over Assyria and ruled the subjects of the god Enlil, and wherein annually, without interruption, they received an income unsurpassed in amount, the tribute of the rulers of the four quarters (of the world);
(but) not one among them had paid heed to (or) shown interest in the palace inside it, the seat of lordly dwelling whose site had become too small; (40) nor had anyone (of them) conceived of and put his mind towards the straightening of the city’s street(s) and the widening of (its) squares, the dredging of the river, (and) the planting of orchards:
(But) as for me, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, the performing of this work came to my attention by the will of the gods and I put my mind to it. I forcibly removed the people of Chaldea, Aramean (tribes), the land of the Manneans, (and) the lands Que and Ḫilakku, who had not submitted to my yoke, then I made them carry baskets (of earth) and they made bricks. I cut down canebrakes in Chaldea and I had their splendid reeds hauled (to Nineveh) for its (the palace’s) construction by enemy soldiers whom I had defeated.
The former palace, which was 360 cubits long opposite the zamû-wall of the ziggurrat, 80 cubits wide opposite the tower of the temple of the goddess Ištar, 134 cubits wide opposite the tower of the Bīt-Kidmuri, (and) 95 cubits wide (on the other side); (45) which earlier kings, my ancestors, had had constructed for their lordly dwelling, but whose construction they had carried out inexpertly — the Tebilti River, a tempestuous flood (of water) which when it rose had destroyed sacred buildings inside the city and exposed the mounds of their tombs (lit. “their mounded tombs”) to the sun, and which had flowed from distant days by the side of the palace and which (thereby) had caused erosion in its foundation when its flood was in full spate (and) had shaken its base:
I tore down that small palace in its entirety, then I changed the course of the Tebilti River, repaired (the effects of) the erosion, and directed its outflow.
In the hidden depths of its subterranean waters I bonded together, with bitumen, reeds below (and) strong mountain stone above, then I raised (that) area out of the water and converted (it) to dry land. (50) I filled in and measured a terrace of 700 large aslu-cubits along (its) longer side, 162 large aslu-cubits along (its) upper, northern shorter side, 217 large aslu-cubits along the inner, shorter side, (and) 386 large aslu-cubits along the lower, southern shorter side, (which is) beside the Tigris River. In order to prevent its foundation from being weakened over the passage of time by cresting flood(s), I surrounded its damp course with large limestone slabs (and thereby) reinforced its base.
I inscribed objects bearing my name 160 courses of brick within the terrace, and I deposited (them) deep down in its foundation for ever after.
Afterwards, I decided to increase the height of the terrace, then I added 20 courses of brick to the former (terrace) and (thus) I raised (it) to a (total) height of 180 courses of brick. (55) I made the area larger than before, added (it) to the former dimensions of the palace, and (thus) enlarged its structure.
I had a palace of elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musuk kannu-wood, cedar, cypress, juniper, and terebinth, (a palace that I named) Egalzagdinutukua (“The Palace Without a Rival”), constructed thereon as my royal residence.
I roofed them (the rooms of the palace) with beams of cedar grown on Mount Amanus, which were brought with difficulty from (that) distant mountain terrain.

I carried off into Assyria a substantial booty (consisting of) 208,000 people, young (and) old, male and female, 7,200 horses (and) mules, 11,073 donkeys, 5,230 camels, 80,100 oxen, (and) 600,600 sheep and goats.
In the course of my campaign, I received a substantial audience gift from Nabû-bēl-šumāti, the official in charge of the city Ḫararatu: gold, silver, large musukkannu-trees, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats.
I put to the sword the population of the city Ḫirimmu, a dangerous enemy, and I did not spare a single one. I hung their corpses on poles and placed (them) around the city. I reorganized that district (and) imposed for eternity one ox, ten sheep, ten homers of wine, (and) twenty homers of dates as his first-fruits offerings to the gods of Assyria, my lords.
On my second campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and I marched to the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians, who since time immemorial had not submitted to the kings, my ancestors. In the high mountains, difficult terrain, I rode on horseback and had my personal chariot carried on (men’s) necks. In very rugged terrain I roamed about on foot like a wild bull. (20) I surrounded (and) conquered the cities Bīt-Kilamzaḫ, Ḫardišpu, (and) Bīt-Kubatti, their fortified walled cities. I brought out from them people, horses, mules, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats, and I counted (them) as booty. Moreover, I destroyed, devastated, (and) turned into ruins their small(er) settlements, which were without number. I burned with fire pavilions (and) tents, their abodes, and reduced (them) to ashes.
I made that city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ a fortress again (and) I strengthened its walls more than before, then I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I brought down from the mountains the people of the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians who had fled from my weapons and I made (them) dwell in the cities Ḫardišpu (and) Bīt-Kubatti. I placed them under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Arrapḫa. I had a stele made, had all the victorious conquests that I achieved over them written on it, and I erected (it) in (that) city.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Ellipi. Before my arrival, Ispabāra, their king, abandoned his fortified cities (and) his treasury and fled far away. I overwhelmed all of his wide land like a fog. I surrounded, conquered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Marʾubištu (and) Akkuddu, cities of his royal house, together with thirty-four small(er) settlements in their environs.
I carried off people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats without number, then I brought him (Ispabāra) to nought and made his land smaller. I detached from his land the cities Ṣi(ṣ)ṣirtu (and) Kummaḫlum, fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements in their environs (and) the district of the land Bīt-Barrû in its entirety, and I added (this area) to the territory of Assyria.
I took the city Elenzaš as a royal city and a fortress for that district, then I changed its former name and called it Kār-Sennacherib. (30) I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I placed (it) under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Ḫarḫar, and (thus) enlarged my land.
On my return march, I received a substantial payment from the distant Medes, of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had heard mention. (Thus) I made them bow down to the yoke of my lordship.
On my third campaign, I marched to the land Ḫatti. Fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed Lulî, the king of the city Sidon, and he fled afar into the midst of the sea. The awesome terror of the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed the cities Great Sidon, Lesser Sidon, Bīt-Zitti, Ṣarepta, Maḫalliba, Ušû, Akzibu, (and) Acco, his fortified cities (and) fortresses, an area of pasture(s) and water-place(s), resources upon which he relied, and they bowed down at my feet.
I placed Tu-Baʾlu on his royal throne over them and imposed upon him tribute (and) payment (in recognition) of my overlordship (to be delivered) yearly (and) without interruption.
As for Minuḫimmu of the city Samsimuruna, Tu-Baʾlu of the city Sidon, Abdi-Liʾti of the city Arwad, Ūru-Milki of the city Byblos, Mitinti of the city Ashdod, Būdi-il of the city Bīt-Ammon, Kammūsu-nadbi of the land Moab, Aya-rāmu of the land Edom, all of the kings of the land Amurru, they brought extensive gifts, four times (the normal amount), as their substantial audience gift before me and kissed my feet.
Moreover, (as for) Ṣidqâ, the king of the city Ashkelon who had not bowed down to my yoke, I forcibly removed the gods of his father’s house, himself, his wife, his sons, his daughters, his brothers, (and other) offspring of his father’s house and took him to Assyria.
I set Šarru-lū-dāri, son of Rūkibtu, their former king, over the people of the city Ashkelon and imposed upon him the payment of tribute (and) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship so that he (now) pulls my yoke.
In the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Bīt-Daganna, Joppa, Banayabarqa, (and) Azuru, the cities of Ṣidqâ that had not submitted to me quickly.
(As for) the governors, the nobles, and the people of the city Ekron who had thrown Padî, their king who was bound by treaty and oaths to Assyria, into iron fetters and who had handed him over to Hezekiah of the land Judah in a hostile manner, they became frightened on account of the villainous acts they had committed. They formed a confederation with the kings of Egypt (and) the archers, chariots, (and) horses of the king of the land Meluḫḫa, forces without number, and they came to their aid.
In the plain of the city Eltekeh, they sharpened their weapons while drawing up in battleline before me. With the support of (the god) Aššur, my lord, I fought with them and defeated them. (45) In the thick of battle, I captured alive the Egyptian charioteers (and) princes (lit. “the sons of the kings”), together with the charioteers of the king of the land Meluḫḫa.
I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Eltekeh (and) Tamnâ. I approached the city Ekron and I killed the governors (and) nobles who had committed crime(s) and hung their corpses on towers around the city; I counted the citizens who had committed the criminal acts as booty; (and) I commanded that the rest of them, (those) who were not guilty of crimes or wrongdoing, (to) whom no penalty was due, be allowed to go free.
I brought out Padî, their king, from the city Jerusalem and placed (him) on the lordly throne over them, then I imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
(As for) Hezekiah of the land Judah, I surrounded (and) conquered forty-six of his fortified walled cities and small(er) settlements in their environs, which were without number, (50) by having ramps trodden down and battering rams brought up, the assault of foot soldiers, sapping, breaching, and siege engines. I brought out of them 200,150 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number, and I counted (them) as booty.
As for him (Hezekiah), I confined him inside the city Jerusalem, his royal city, like a bird in a cage. I set up blockades against him and made him dread exiting his city gate. I detached from his land the cities of his that I had plundered and I gave (them) to Mitinti, the king of the city Ashdod, and Padî, the king of the city Ekron, (and) Ṣilli-Bēl, the king of the land Gaza, (and thereby) made his land smaller. To the former tribute, their annual giving, I added the payment (of) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship and imposed (it) upon them.
As for him, Hezekiah, fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed him and, after my (departure), he had the auxiliary forces (and) his elite troops whom he had brought inside to strengthen the city Jerusalem, his royal city, and who had provided support, (along with) 30 talents of gold, 800 talents of silver, choice antimony, large blocks of ..., ivory beds, armchairs of ivory, elephant hide(s), elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, garments with multi-colored trim, linen garments, blue-purple wool, red-purple wool, utensils of bronze, iron, copper, tin, (and) iron, chariots, shields, lances, armor, iron belt-daggers, bows and uṣṣu-arrows, equipment, (and) implements of war, (all of) which were without number, together with his daughters, his palace women, male singers, (and) female singers brought into Nineveh, my capital city, and he sent a mounted messenger of his to me to deliver (this) payment and to do obeisance.
From the booty of those lands that I had plundered, I conscripted 10,000 archers (and) 10,000 shield bearers and added (them) to my royal contingent. (60) I divided up the rest of the substantial enemy booty like sheep and goats among my entire camp and my governors, (and) the people of my great cult centers.
At that time, Nineveh, the exalted cult center, the city loved by the goddess Ištar in which all of the rituals for gods and goddesses are present; the enduring foundation (and) eternal base whose plan had been designed by the stars (lit. “writing”) of the firmament and whose arrangement was made manifest since time immemorial; a sophisticated place (and) site of secret lore in which every kind of skilled craftsmanship, all of the rituals, (and) the secret(s) of the lalgar (cosmic subterranean water) are apprehended;
in which since time immemorial earlier kings, my ancestors, before me exercised dominion over Assyria and ruled the subjects of the god Enlil, (65) and wherein annually, without interruption, they received an enormous income, the tribute of the rulers of the four quarters (of the world);
(but) not one among them had paid heed to (or) shown interest in the palace inside it, the seat of lordly dwelling whose site had become too small; nor had anyone (of them) conceived of and put his mind towards the straightening of the city’s street(s) and the widening of (its) squares, the dredging of the river, (and) the planting of orchards:
(But) as for me, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, the performing of this work came to my attention by the will of the gods and I put my mind to it. I forcibly removed the people of Chaldea, Aramean (tribes), the land of the Manneans, the lands Que, Ḫilakku, (and) Philistia, and the land (of the city) Tyre, who had not submitted to my yoke, then I made them carry baskets (of earth) and they made bricks. (70) I cut down canebrakes in Chaldea and I had their splendid reeds hauled (to Nineveh) for its (the palace’s) construction by enemy soldiers whom I had defeated.
The former palace, which was 360 cubits long opposite the zamû-wall of the ziggurrat, 80 cubits wide opposite the tower of the temple of the goddess Ištar, 134 cubits wide opposite the tower of the Bīt-Kidmuri, (and) 95 cubits wide (on the other side); which earlier kings, my ancestors, had had constructed for their lordly dwelling, but whose construction they had carried out inexpertly — the Tebilti River, a tempestuous flood (of water) which when it rose had destroyed sacred buildings inside the city and exposed their hidden tombs to the sun, and which had flowed from distant days by the side of the palace and which (thereby) had caused erosion in its foundation when its flood was in full spate (and) had shaken its base:
I tore down that small palace in its entirety, then I changed the course of the Tebilti River, repaired (the effects of) the erosion, and directed its outflow.
In the hidden depths of (its) subterranean waters I bonded together, with bitumen, reeds below (and) strong mountain stone above, then I raised (that) area out of the water and converted (it) to dry land. I filled in and measured a terrace of 700 large aslu-cubits along (its) longer side, 176 large aslu-cubits along (its) upper, northern shorter side, 268 large aslu-cubits along the inner, shorter side, (which is) opposite the zamû-wall of the shrine behind (the temple of) the goddess Ištar, 383 large aslu-cubits along the other, parallel, inner shorter side, (which is) on the west behind the ziggurrat of the temple of the goddess Ištar, (and) 386 large aslu-cubits along the lower, southern shorter side, (which is) beside the Tigris River. (80) In order to prevent its foundation from being weakened over the passage of time by cresting flood(s), I surrounded its base with large limestone slabs (and thereby) reinforced its base.
I inscribed objects bearing my name 160 courses of brick within the terrace and I deposited (them) deep down in its foundation for ever after.
Afterwards, I decided to increase the height of the terrace, then I added 20 courses of brick to the former (terrace) and (thus) I raised (it) to a (total) height of 180 courses of brick. I made the area larger than before, added (it) to the former dimensions of the palace, and (thus) enlarged its structure.
I had a palace of alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, cypress, daprānu-juniper, juniper, and terebinth, (a palace that I named) Egalzagdinutukua (“The Palace Without a Rival”), constructed thereon as my royal residence.
I planted alongside it (the palace) a botanical garden, a replica of Mount Amanus, which has all kinds of aromatic plants (and) fruit trees, trees that are the mainstay of the mountains and Chaldea, collected inside it.
To plant gardens, I subdivided the meadowland upstream of the city into plots of two pānu each for the citizens of Nineveh and I handed (them) over to them.
To make (those) planted areas luxuriant, I cut with picks a canal straight through mountain and valley, from the border of the city Kisiru to the plain of Nineveh. I caused an inexhaustible supply of water to flow there for a distance of one and a half leagues from the Ḫusur River (and) made (it) gush through feeder canals into those gardens.
I enlarged the site of Nineveh, my capital city. I broadened its squares and brought light into the alleys and streets, making (them) as bright as day.
I had a bridge constructed opposite the Citadel Gate (by packing down) paving stones of white limestone for my lordly procession(s).
I had an inscribed object made and inscribed thereon all the mighty victories that I achieved over all of (my) enemies with the support of (the god) Aššur, the great lord, my lord, and everything (else) that I had been doing. I deposited (it) in the foundation of my lordly palace for ever after.
In the future, may one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur names for shepherding the land and people, renovate its dilapidated section(s) when that palace becomes old and dilapidated. May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Aššur will (then) hear his prayers.
The line count of the inscription is 94 (lines). Ayyāru (II), eponymy of Mitūnu, governor of the city Isāna (700).
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), capable shepherd, favorite of the great gods, guardian of truth who loves justice, renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (and) strives after good deeds, perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning:

I enlarged the site of the citadel and Nineveh, my capital city. I broadened their squares and brought light into the alleys and streets, making (them) as bright as day.
I had a bridge constructed opposite the Citadel Gate with paving stones of white limestone for the passage of my lordly chariot.
I had an inscribed object made and had all the mighty victories that I achieved over all of (my) enemies with the support of (the god) Aššur, the great lord, my lord, and all of my (other) achievements inscribed thereon. With inscribed objects of earlier rulers, my ancestors, I deposited (it) for ever after in the citadel wall of Nineveh, my capital city, for the kings, my descendants.
At any time (in the future), may one of my descendants (lit. “future children”), whom the god Aššur names for shepherding the land and people, renovate its dilapidated section(s) when that wall becomes old and dilapidated. May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Aššur and the goddess Ištar will (then) hear his prayers.
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, unrivalled king, pious shepherd who reveres the great gods, guardian of truth who loves justice, renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (and) strives after good deeds, perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning:
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises.
On my first campaign, I brought about the defeat of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), together with the troops of (the land) Elam, his allies, in the plain of Kish. In the midst of that battle he abandoned his camp, fled alone, and (thereby) saved his life. I seized the chariots, horses, wagons, (and) mules that he had abandoned in the thick of battle.
I joyfully entered his palace, which is in Babylon, then I opened his treasury and brought out gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, precious stones, all kinds of possessions (and) property, a substantial treasure, (together with) his wife, his palace women, courtiers, attendants, all of the craftsmen, as many as there were, (and) his palace attendants, and I counted (them) as booty.
With the strength of the god Aššur, my lord, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered 89 of his fortified cities, fortresses of Chaldea, and 620 small(er) settlements in their environs. (10) I brought out the auxiliary forces of the Arameans (and) Chaldeans who were in Uruk, Nippur, Kish, Ḫursagkalama, Cutha, (and) Sippar, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.
I placed Bēl-ibni, a son of a rab banî, on his royal throne (and) entrusted him with the people of Akkad. I appointed my eunuchs to be governors over all of the districts of Chaldea and I imposed the yoke of my lordship upon them.
On my return march, I defeated all together the Tuʾumuna, Riḫiḫu, Yadaqqu, Ubudu, Gibrê, Maliḫu (Malaḫu), Gurumu, Ubulu, Damunu, Gambulu, Ḫindaru, Ruʾuʾa, Puqudu, Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu, insubmissive Arameans. I carried off into Assyria a substantial booty (consisting of) 208,000 people, young (and) old, male and female, 7,200 horses (and) mules, 11,073 donkeys, 5,230 camels, 80,100 oxen, (and) 600,600 sheep and goats.
In the course of my campaign, I received a substantial audience gift from Nabû-bēl-šumāti, the official in charge of the city Ḫararatu: gold, silver, large musukkannu-trees, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats.

To make (these) planted areas luxuriant, I cut with picks a canal straight through mountain and valley, from the border of the city Kisiru to the plain of Nineveh. I caused an inexhaustible supply of water to flow there for a distance of one and a half leagues from the Ḫusur River (and) made (it) gush through feeder canals into those gardens.
By divine will, vines, all kinds of fruit trees, olive trees, and aromatic trees flourished greatly in (those) gardens. Cypress trees, musukkannu-trees, (and) all kinds of trees grew tall and sent out shoots. (5´) I created a marsh to moderate the flow of water for (those) gardens and had a canebrake planted (in it). I let loose in it herons, wild boars (lit. “pigs of the reeds”), (and) roe deer. The marshes thrived greatly. Birds of the heavens, heron(s) whose home(s) are far away, made nest(s) and wild boars (and) roe deer gave birth in abundance.
I cut down musukkannu-trees (and) cypress trees grown in the orchards (and) marsh reeds from the swamps and I used (them) in the work required (to build) my lordly palatial halls.
... At the inauguration of the palace, I had the heads of the subjects of my land drenched (and) I watered their insides with sweet wine.
Nineveh, the site of whose circumference had been 9,300 cubits since former times (and) for which no earlier ruler had had an inner or outer wall built — (10´) I added 12,515 (cubits) in the plain around the city to (its) previous measurement and (thus) established its dimensions as 21,815 large cubits.
I laid the foundation of its great wall, Badnigalbilukurašušu, (which means) “Wall Whose Brilliance Overwhelms Enemies,” upon limestone and made (it) 40 bricks thick. I raised its superstructure 180 courses of brick high.
I opened up a foundation pit for the outer wall, Badnigerimḫuluḫa, (which means) “Terrorizer of Enemies,” then I dug down forty-five nindanu and made (it) reach the water table. I bound together strong mountain stone in the water below and above I expertly carried out its construction with large limestone (blocks) up to its copings.
I enlarged the site of Nineveh, my capital city. I broadened its squares, making (them) as bright as day. I had an inner (and) outer wall built and I raised (them) as high as mountain(s).
So that there would be outflow from the Ḫusur River in the city (and) the passage of water upstream and downstream, I built aqueducts beneath it (the city wall) with baked bricks, ....
I had a bridge constructed opposite the Citadel Gate with paving stones of white limestone for the passage of my lordly chariot.
I had an inscribed object made and had all the mighty victories that I achieved over all of (my) enemies with the support of (the god) Aššur, the great lord, my lord, and all of my (other) achievements inscribed thereon. With inscribed objects of earlier rulers, my ancestors, I deposited (it) for ever after in the wall of Nineveh, my capital city, for the kings, my descendants.

At the beginning of my kingship, I brought about the defeat of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), together with the troops of (the land) Elam, his ally, in the plain of Kish. I seized the chariots, wagons, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, and Bactrian camels that he had abandoned in the thick of battle.

Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), capable shepherd, (i 5) favorite of the great gods, guardian of truth who loves justice, renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (and) strives after good deeds, (i 10) perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning:
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises. He made all of the black-headed (people) from the Upper Sea of the Setting Sun (i 20) to the Lower Sea of the Rising Sun bow down at my feet.
I joyfully entered his palace, which is in Babylon, then I opened his treasury and brought out gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, precious stones, (i 5´) all kinds of possessions (and) property without number, a substantial tribute, (together with) his palace women, courtiers, attendants, male singers, female singers, all of the craftsmen, as many as there were, (and) his palace attendants, and I counted (them) as booty.
With the strength of the god Aššur, my lord, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered 75 of his fortified cities, fortresses of Chaldea, and 420 small(er) settlements in their environs. I brought out the auxiliary forces of the Arameans (and) Chaldeans who were in Uruk, Nippur, Kish, Ḫursagkalama, Cutha, (and) Sippar, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.
On my return march, I defeated all together the Tuʾumuna, Riḫiḫu, Yadaqqu, Ubudu, Gibrê, Maliḫu (Malaḫu), Gurumu, (i 25´) Ubulu, Damunu, Gambulu, Ḫindaru, Ruʾuʾa, Puqudu, Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu, (i 30´) insubmissive Arameans. I carried off into Assyria a substantial booty (consisting of) 208,000 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number.
In the course of my campaign, I received a substantial audience gift from Nabû-bēl-šumāti, the official in charge of the city Ḫararatu: gold, silver, large musukkannu-trees, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats.
I put to the sword the population of the city Ḫirimmu, a dangerous enemy, and I did not spare a single one. I hung their corpses on poles (and) placed (them) around the city. (ii 5) I reorganized that district (and) imposed for eternity one yoke ox, ten sheep, ten homers of wine, (and) twenty homers of dates as his first-fruits offerings to the gods of Assyria, my lords.
I brought out of them ... ... ... sheep and goats, and I counted (them) as booty. Moreover, I destroyed, devastated, (and) turned into ruins their small(er) settlements, which were without number. I burned with fire pavilions (and) tents, their abodes, and reduced (them) to ashes.
I made that city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ a fortress again (and) I strengthened its walls more than before, then I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered.
I had a stele made, had all the victorious conquests that I achieved over them written on it, and I erected (it) in (that) city.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Ellipi. (ii 5´´) Before my arrival, Ispabāra, their king, abandoned his fortified cities (and) his treasury and fled far away. I overwhelmed all of his wide land like a fog. I surrounded, conquered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Marʾubištu (and) Akkuddu, (ii 10´´) cities of his royal house, together with thirty-four small(er) settlements in their environs.
I carried off people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, (ii 15´´) oxen, and sheep and goats without number, then I brought him (Ispabāra) to nought and made his land smaller. I detached from his land the cities Ṣi(ṣ)ṣirtu (and) Kummaḫlum, fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements (ii 20´´) in their environs (and) the district of the land Bīt-Barrû in its entirety, and I added (this area) to the territory of Assyria.
I took the city Elenzaš as a royal city and a fortress for that district, then I changed its former name and called it Kār-Sennacherib. I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. (ii 30´´) I placed (it) under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Ḫarḫar, and (thus) enlarged my land.
On my return march, I received a substantial payment from the distant Medes, of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had heard mention. (Thus) I made them bow down to the yoke of my lordship.
On my third campaign, I marched to the land Ḫatti. Fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed Lulî, the king of the city Sidon, and (iii 5) he fled afar into the midst of the sea and disappeared. The awesome terror of the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed the cities Great Sidon, Lesser Sidon, Bīt-Zitti, Ṣarepta, Maḫalliba, Ušû, (iii 10) Akzibu, (and) Acco, his fortified cities (and) fortresses, an area of pasture(s) and water-place(s), resources upon which he relied, and they bowed down at my feet.
I placed Tu-Baʾlu on the royal throne over them and imposed upon him tribute (and) payment (in recognition) of my overlordship (to be delivered) yearly (and) without interruption.
I imposed upon him (Šarru-lū-dāri) the payment of tribute (and) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship so that he (now) pulls my yoke.
In the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Bīt-Daganna, Joppa, Banayabarqa, (and) Azuru, (iii 5´) the cities of Ṣidqâ that had not submitted to me quickly.
(As for) the governors, the nobles, and the people of the city Ekron who had thrown Padî, their king who was bound by treaty (iii 10´) and oaths to Assyria, into iron fetters and who had handed him over to Hezekiah of the land Judah in a hostile manner, they became frightened on account of the villainous acts they had committed. They formed a confederation with the kings of Egypt (and) the archers, (iii 15´) chariots, (and) horses of the king of the land Meluḫḫa, forces without number, and they came to their aid.
In the plain of the city Eltekeh, they sharpened their weapons while drawing up in battleline before me. With the support of the god Aššur, my lord, I fought with them and defeated them. In the thick of battle, I captured alive the Egyptian charioteers and princes (lit. “the sons of the king”), together with the charioteers of the king of the land Meluḫḫa.
I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Eltekeh (and) Tamnâ. I approached the city Ekron and I killed the governors (and) nobles who had committed crime(s) and (iii 30´) hung their corpses on towers around the city; I counted the citizens who had committed the criminal acts as booty; (and) I commanded that the rest of them, (those) who were not guilty of crimes or wrongdoing, (to) whom no penalty was due, be allowed to go free.
I brought out Padî, their king, from the city Jerusalem and placed (him) on the lordly throne over them, then I imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
Moreover, (as for) Hezekiah of the land Judah, who had not submitted to my yoke, I surrounded (and) conquered forty-six of his fortified walled cities and small(er) settlements in their environs, (iv 10) which were without number, by having ramps trodden down and battering rams brought up, the assault of foot soldiers, sapping, breaching, and siege engines. I brought out of them 200,150 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, (iv 15) camels, oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number, and I counted (them) as booty.
As for him (Hezekiah), I confined him inside the city Jerusalem, his royal city, like a bird in a cage. (iv 20) I set up blockades against him and made made him dread exiting his city gate. I detached from his land the cities of his that I had plundered and I gave (them) to Mitinti, the king of the city Ashdod, Padî, the king of the city Ekron, and Ṣilli-Bēl, the king of the city Gaza,
and, after my (departure), he (Hezekiah) had the auxiliary forces and his elite troops whom he had brought inside to strengthen the city Jerusalem, his royal city, and who had provided support, along with 30 talents of gold, (iv 5´) 800 talents of silver, choice antimony, large blocks of ..., ivory beds, armchairs of ivory, elephant hide(s), elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, every kind of valuable treasure, (iv 10´) as well as his daughters, his palace women, male singers, (and) female singers brought into Nineveh, my capital city, and he sent a mounted messenger of his to me to deliver (this) payment and to do obeisance.
On my fourth campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me so that I mustered my numerous troops and ordered the march to the land Bīt-Yakīn. In the course of my campaign, I defeated Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), a Chaldean who lives in the marshes, (iv 20´) at the city Bittūtu. As for him, terror of doing battle with me fell upon him and his heart pounded. He fled alone like a lynx and his (hiding) place could not be found.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Bīt-Yakīn. He — Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), whom I had defeated and whose forces I had scattered during my first campaign — became frightened by the clangor of my mighty weapons (iv 30´) and my fierce battle array, then dislodged the gods of the (full) extent of his land from their abodes, and loaded (them) onto boats. He flew away like a bird to (the city) Nagīte-raqqi, which is in the midst of the sea. I brought his brothers, the seed of his father’s house, whom he had abandoned at the shore of the sea, together with the rest of the people of his land, out of the land Bīt-Yakīn, (v 1) which is in the swamps (and) marshes, and I counted (them) as booty.
Once again I destroyed (and) devastated his cities, (and) turned (them) into ruins. I poured out awe-inspiring brilliance upon his ally, the king of the land Elam.
On my return march, I placed Aššur-nādin-šumi, my first-born son (whom I) raised on my (own) knee, on his lordly throne and entrusted him with the wide land of Sumer and Akkad.
From the booty of those lands that I had plundered, I conscripted 20,000 archers (and) 15,000 shield bearers and added (them) to my royal contingent. I divided up the rest of the substantial enemy booty (v 15) like sheep and goats among my entire camp (and) my governors, (and) the people of my great cult centers.
At that time, Nineveh, the exalted cult center, the city loved by the goddess Ištar (v 20) in which all of the rituals for gods and goddesses are present; the enduring foundation (and) eternal base whose plan had been designed by the stars (lit. “writing”) of the firmament and whose arrangement was made manifest since time immemorial; (v 25) a sophisticated place (and) site of secret lore in which every kind of skilled craftsmanship, all of the rituals, (and) the secret(s) of the lalgar (cosmic subterranean water) are apprehended;
in which since time immemorial earlier kings, my ancestors, before me (v 30) exercised dominion over Assyria and ruled the subjects of the god Enlil; (but) not one among them had conceived of and put his mind towards increasing the site of the city, building wall(s), straightening the streets, or dredging the river (and) planting orchards; nor had any (of them) paid heed to (or) shown (v 35) interest in the palace inside it, the seat of lordly dwelling whose site had become too small (and) whose construction was inexpert:
(But) as for me, Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria, the performing of this work came to my attention by the will of the gods and I put my mind to it. I forcibly removed the people of Chaldea, Aramean (tribes), the land of the Manneans, the lands Que, Ḫilakku, (and) Philistia, (v 45) and the land (of the city) Tyre, who had not submitted to my yoke, then I made them carry baskets (of earth and) they made bricks.
The former palace, which was 360 cubits long, 80 cubits wide opposite the zamû-wall of the ziggurrat, (v 50) 134 cubits wide opposite the tower of the temple of the goddess Ištar, (and) 95 cubits wide opposite the tower of the Bīt-Kidmuri; which earlier kings, my ancestors, had had constructed for their lordly dwelling, but whose construction they had carried out inexpertly:
They quarried mountain sheep colossi of white limestone in the city Tastiate, which is across the Tigris River, to be their (the palatial halls’) gatekeepers. Throughout their entire land they depleted forests of large trees to have boats built. (v 60) In the month Ayyāru (II), the time of spring floods, they brought (the colossi) across to this side (of the river) with difficulty in magnificent boats. They sank large boats at the quay dock (and then) made their crews struggle (and) strain. (v 65) With might and main, they struggled to transport (the colossi) and install (them) in their gates.
The Tebilti River, a tempestuous flood (of water) which had flowed from distant days by the side of the palace and which had caused erosion in its foundation when its flood was in full spate (and) had shaken its base:
I tore down that small palace in its entirety, then I changed the course of the Tebilti River, repaired (the effects of) the erosion, and directed its outflow.
In the hidden depths of its subterranean waters I bonded together, with bitumen, reeds below (and) strong mountain stone above, then I raised (that) area out of the water and converted (it) to dry land. I added to the dimensions of the former terrace a plot of land that was 288 cubits wide. (vi 10) In total, I filled in and measured a terrace of 700 large aslu-cubits along (its) longer side, 176 large aslu-cubits along (its) upper, northern shorter side, 268 large aslu-cubits along the inner, shorter side, (which is) opposite the zamû-wall of the shrine behind (the temple of) the goddess Ištar, 443 large aslu-cubits along (vi 15) the other, parallel, inner shorter side, (which is) on the west behind the ziggurrat of the temple of the goddess Ištar, (and) 386 large aslu-cubits along the lower, southern shorter side, (which is) beside the Tigris River.
So that the construction of my palace might be carried out correctly and that my handiwork be completed, at that time, the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar revealed to me the presence of white limestone in the city Balāṭāya. (vi 25) Therein, I quarried mighty mountain sheep colossi, sphinxes, and large stone slabs for the gates of my lordly palace.
In order to prevent the foundation of the terrace from being weakened over the passage of time by cresting flood(s), (vi 30) I surrounded its base with large limestone (slabs and thereby) reinforced its base.
I inscribed objects bearing my name 160 courses of brick within the terrace and I deposited (them) deep down in its foundation for ever after.
Afterwards, I decided to increase the height of the terrace, then I added 30 courses of brick to the former (terrace) and (thus) I raised (it) to a height of 190 courses of brick. I made the area larger than before, (vi 40) added (it) to the former dimensions of the palace, and (thus) enlarged its structure.
I had a palace of breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, cypress, juniper, and elammaku-wood, (vi 45) (a palace that I named) Egalzagdinutukua (“The Palace Without a Rival”), constructed thereon as my royal residence.
I roofed them (the palatial halls) with beams of cedar (and) cypress, whose scent is sweet, product(s) of Mount Amanus (and) the yield of Mount Sirāra, the holy mountains. I fastened bands of shining silver (and) bright copper on (vi 50) magnificent doors of cedar, cypress, (and) juniper and I installed (them) in their gates. I decorated them (the doors) with silver and copper knobbed nails. I adorned the arches, friezes, and all of the copings with baked bricks (vi 55) (glazed in the color of) obsidian (and) lapis lazuli.
For my lordly pleasure, I had a portico, a replica of a Hittite palace, which is called bīt-ḫilā ni in the language of the land Amurru, constructed inside them.
Twelve striding lions of shining copper (and) fierce demeanor, (which were) standing opposite one another, which were skillfully cast through the craftsmanship of the god Ninagal, and which were filled with radiance — upon (those) lion colossi I installed two identical columns that were cast from bronze, together with four large cedar columns, and I positioned cross-beams (upon them) as a cornice for their gates.
I covered ten sphinxes of cast bright urudû-copper with shining zaḫalû-silver and (over them), over ten sphinxes of alabaster, (and) over twelve sphinxes of cast ...-metal I erected two magnificent ebony columns, whose inlays are pašallu-gold, and columns of cedar, cypress, (and) daprānu-juniper (vi 75) with eš marû-silver and bronze inlays, and I positioned the architraves of my lordly palatial halls (on those columns).
Moreover, I made twelve mountain sheep colossi of cast bright urudû-copper, which are splendid in form (and) perfect in shape, (vii 1) two mountain sheep colossi of alabaster, (and) seventy-two mountain sheep colossi and sphinxes of white limestone suitable for holding the door bolt(s) for leaving and entering.
I engraved on slabs of breccia (and) alabaster, and on large limestone slabs (images of) the enemy settlements that I had conquered. I surrounded their (the palace rooms’) lower courses (with them and) made (them) an object of wonder.
I planted alongside it (the palace) a botanical garden, a replica of Mount Amanus, which has all kinds of aromatic plants (and) fruit trees, trees that are the mainstay of the mountains and Chaldea, collected inside it.
Nineveh, the site of whose circumference had been 9,300 cubits since former times (and) for which no earlier ruler had had an inner or outer wall built — I added 12, 515 (cubits) in the plain around the city to (its) previous measurement and (thus) established its dimensions as 21,815 large cubits.
I laid the foundation of its great wall, Badnigalbilukurašušu, (which means) “Wall Whose Brilliance Overwhelms Enemies,” upon limestone and made (it) 40 bricks thick. I raised its superstructure 180 courses of brick high.
I had fourteen gates opened up in it in four directions, in front and behind, (and) along both sides, for entering and leaving.
“The God Šarur Is the One Who Cuts Down the King’s Enemy”: (this is) the Ḫandūru Gate. “May the Vice-Regent of the God Aššur Endure”:
(this is) the Šamaš Gate, which (leads to) the land Gagal. “O Ištar Bless the One Who Provides for You!”: (this is) the Mullissu Gate, which (leads to) the city Kār-Mullissi. “The One Who Exorcises the ‘Flesh’ of the Asakku-demon”: (this is) the Step Gate. (vii 5´) “The Choicest of Grain and Flocks Are Constantly Inside It”: (this is) the gate (that leads to) the city Šibaniba. “The Bearer of the Produce of the Mountains”: (this is) the gate (that leads to) the land Ḫalaḫḫu. In total, eight gates (facing) the rising sun, towards the south and east, (vii 10´) (and) I gave them (these) names.
“The God Adad Is the Provider of Prosperity to the Land”: (this is) the Adad Gate, which (leads to) the game preserve. “The God Erra Is the One Who Cuts Down Enemies”: (this is) the Nergal Gate, which (leads to) the city Tarbiṣu. (vii 15´) “The God Igisigsig Is the One Who Makes Orchards Flourish”: (this is) the Gate of the Gardens. In total, three gates (facing) towards the north (and) I gave them (these) names.
“The God Ea Is the One Who Properly Directs (Water Flow into) My Cisterns”: (this is) the Mašqû Gate. (vii 20´) “The One Who Brings in Income from the Settlements”: (this is) the Quay Gate. “The One Who Regulates Everything”: (this is) the Armory Gate. In total, three gates (facing) towards the west (and) I gave them (these) names.
I opened up a foundation pit for the outer wall, Badnigerimḫuluḫa, (which means) “Terrorizer of Enemies,” then I dug down forty-five nindanu and made (it) reach the water table. I bound together strong mountain stone in the water below and above I expertly carried out its construction with large limestone (blocks) up to its copings.
I enlarged the site of Nineveh, my capital city. I broadened its squares, making (them) as bright as day.
I had a bridge constructed opposite the Citadel Gate with paving stones of white limestone for the passage of my lordly chariot.
Beside the city, in a botanical garden (one) pānu (in size and) a garden (one) pānu (in size) for a game preserve, I gathered every type of aromatic tree of the land Ḫatti, fruit trees of all lands, (and) trees that are the mainstay of the mountains and Chaldea. Upstream of the city, on newly tilled soil, I planted vines, every type of fruit tree, and olive trees.
For the expansion of orchards, I subdivided the meadowland upstream of the city into plots of two pānu each for the citizens of Nineveh and I handed (them) over to them. To make (those) planted areas luxuriant, (viii 15´) I cut with iron picks a canal straight through mountain and valley, from the border of the city Kisiru to the plain of Nineveh. I caused an inexhaustible supply of water to flow there for a distance of one and a half leagues from the Ḫusur River ... ...
... ... ... Wild boars (and) roe deer gave birth in abundance.
I cut down musukkan nu-trees (and) cypress trees grown in the orchards (and) marsh reeds from the swamps and I used (them) in the work required (to build) my lordly palatial halls.
After I had finished the work on my palace, (viii 10´´) I invited inside it the god Aššur, the great lord, (and) the gods and goddesses living in Assyria, then I made splendid offerings and presented my gift(s). (viii 15´´) I made fine oil from olives and aromatics from the orchards (planted) on newly tilled soil. At the inauguration of the palace, I had the heads of the subjects of my land drenched (and) I watered their insides with sweet wine.
In the future, may one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur names for shepherding the land and people, renovate its dilapidated section(s) when that wall becomes old and dilapidated. May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, (viii 25´´) anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Aššur and the goddess Ištar will (then) hear his prayers.

Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), (i 5) capable shepherd, favorite of the great gods, guardian of truth who loves justice, renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (i 10) (and) strives after good deeds, perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning:
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises. He made all of the black-headed (people) from the Upper Sea (i 20) of the Setting Sun to the Lower Sea of the Rising Sun bow down at my feet. Thus did recalcitrant rulers come to fear battle with me. While they were abandoning their settlements, (i 25) they flew away alone like bats (living) in crevices to inaccessible place(s).
On my first campaign, I brought about the defeat of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), (i 30) together with the troops of (the land) Elam, his allies, in the plain of Kish. In the midst of that battle he abandoned his camp, fled alone, and (thereby) saved his life. (i 35) I seized the chariots, horses, wagons, (and) mules that he had abandoned in the thick of battle.
I joyfully entered his palace, which is in Babylon, then (i 40) I opened his treasury and brought out gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, precious stones, all kinds of possessions (and) property without number, a substantial tribute, (together with) his palace women, courtiers, attendants, (i 45) male singers, female singers, all of the craftsmen, as many as there were, (and) his palace attendants, and I counted (them) as booty.
With the strength of the god Aššur, my lord, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered 75 of his fortified cities, fortresses of Chaldea, and 420 small(er) settlements in their environs. I brought out the auxiliary forces of the Arameans (and) Chaldeans (i 55) who were in Uruk, Nippur, Kish, Ḫursagkalama, Cutha, (and) Sippar, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.
On my return march, I defeated all together the Tuʾumuna, Riḫiḫu, Yadaqqu, Ubudu, Gibrê, Malaḫu, Gurumu, Ubulu, Damunu, Gambulu, (i 65) Ḫindaru, Ruʾuʾa, Puqudu, Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu, insubmissive Arameans. I carried off into Assyria a substantial booty (i 70) (consisting of) 208,000 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number.
In the course of my campaign, I received a substantial audience gift from Nabû-bēl-šumāti, the official in charge of the city Ḫararatu: gold, silver, large musukkannu-trees, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats.
I put to the sword the population of the city Ḫirimmu, a dangerous enemy, and I did not spare a single one. I hung their corpses on poles and (ii 1) placed (them) around the city. I reorganized that district (and) imposed for eternity one ox, ten sheep, ten homers of wine, (and) twenty homers of dates as his first-fruits offerings to the gods of Assyria, my lords.
On my second campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and I marched to the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians, who since time immemorial had not submitted to the kings, (ii 10) my ancestors. In the high mountains, difficult terrain, I rode on horseback and had my personal chariot carried on (men’s) necks. In very rugged terrain I roamed about on foot like a wild bull.
I surrounded (and) conquered the cities Bīt-Kilamzaḫ, Ḫardišpu, (and) Bīt-Kubatti, their fortified walled cities. I brought out of them people, horses, mules, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats, and I counted (them) as booty. Moreover, I destroyed, devastated, (and) turned into ruins their small(er) settlements, (ii 20) which were without number. I burned with fire pavilions (and) tents, their abodes, and reduced (them) to ashes.
I made that city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ a fortress again (and) I strengthened its walls more than before, then I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I brought down from the mountains the people of the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians (ii 30) who had fled from my weapons and I made (them) dwell in the cities Ḫardišpu (and) Bīt-Kubatti. I placed them under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Arrapḫa. (ii 35) I had a stele made, had all the victorious conquests that I achieved over them written on it, and I erected (it) in (that) city.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and (ii 40) took the road to the land Ellipi. Before my arrival, Ispabāra, their king, abandoned his fortified cities (and) his treasury and fled far away. I overwhelmed all of his wide land like a fog. (ii 45) I surrounded, conquered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Marʾubištu (and) Akkuddu, cities of his royal house, together with thirty-four small(er) settlements in their environs.
I carried off people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats without number, then I brought him (Ispabāra) to nought and made his land smaller. I detached from his land the cities Ṣi(ṣ)ṣirtu (and) Kummaḫlum, (ii 55) fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements in their environs (and) the district of the land Bīt-Barrû in its entirety, and I added (this area) to the territory of Assyria.
I took the city Elenzaš as a royal city and a fortress for that district, then I changed its former name and called it Kār-Sennacherib. (ii 65) I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I placed (it) under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Ḫarḫar, and (thus) enlarged my land.
On my return march, I received a substantial payment from the distant Medes, of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had heard mention. (Thus) I made them bow down to the yoke of my lordship.
On my third campaign, I marched to the land Ḫatti. Fear of my lordly brilliance (iii 1) overwhelmed Lulî, the king of the city Sidon, and he fled afar into the midst of the sea and disappeared. The awesome terror of the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed the cities Great Sidon, Lesser Sidon, (iii 5) Bīt-Zitti, Ṣarepta, Maḫalliba, Ušû, Akzibu, (and) Acco, his fortified cities (and) fortresses, an area of pasture(s) and water-place(s), (iii 10) resources upon which he relied, and they bowed down at my feet.
I placed Tu-Baʾlu on the royal throne over them and imposed upon him tribute (and) payment (in recognition) of my overlordship (to be delivered) yearly (and) without interruption.
As for Min(u)ḫimmu of the city Samsimuruna, Tu-Baʾlu of the city Sidon, Abdi-Liʾti of the city Arwad, Ūru-Milki of the city Byblos, Mitinti of the city Ashdod, (iii 20) Būdi-il of the land Bīt-Ammon, Kammūsu-nadbi of the land Moab, Aya-rāmu of the land Edom, all of the kings of the land Amurru, they brought extensive gifts, four times (the normal amount), as their substantial audience gift before me and kissed my feet.
Moreover, (as for) Ṣidqâ, the king of the city Ashkelon who had not bowed down to my yoke, I forcibly removed the gods of his father’s house, himself, his wife, his sons, his daughters, his brothers, (and other) offspring of his father’s house (iii 30) and took him to Assyria.
I set Šarru-lū-dāri, son of Rūkibtu, their former king, over the people of the city Ashkelon and imposed upon him the payment of tribute (and) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship so that he (now) pulls my yoke.
In the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Bīt-Daganna, Joppa, Banayabarqa, (and) Azuru, the cities of Ṣidqâ that had not submitted to me quickly.
(As for) the governors, the nobles, and the people of the city Ekron who had thrown Padî, their king who was bound by treaty and oaths to Assyria, into iron fetters and who had handed him over to Hezekiah of the land Judah in a hostile manner, (iii 45) they became frightened on account of the villainous acts they had committed. They formed a confederation with the kings of Egypt (and) the archers, chariots, (and) horses of the king of the land Meluḫḫa, forces without number, and they came to their aid.
In the plain of the city Eltekeh, they sharpened their weapons while drawing up in battleline before me. With the support of the god Aššur, my lord, I fought with them and defeated them. (iii 55) In the thick of battle, I captured alive the Egyptian charioteers and princes (lit. “the sons of the king”), together with the charioteers of the king of the land Meluḫḫa.
I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Eltekeh (and) Tamnâ. I approached the city Ekron and I killed the governors (and) nobles who had committed crime(s) and hung their corpses on towers around the city; (iii 65) I counted the citizens who had committed the criminal acts as booty; (and) I commanded that the rest of them, (those) who were not guilty of crimes or wrongdoing, (to) whom no penalty was due, be allowed to go free.
I brought out Padî, their king, from the city Jerusalem and placed (him) on the lordly throne over them, then I imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
Moreover, (as for) Hezekiah of the land Judah, who had not submitted to my yoke, I surrounded (and) conquered forty-six of his fortified cities, fortresses, and small(er) settlements in their environs, which were without number, by having ramps trodden down and battering rams brought up, (iv 1) the assault of foot soldiers, sapping, breaching, and siege engines. I brought out of them 200,150 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number, and I counted (them) as booty.
As for him (Hezekiah), I confined him inside the city Jerusalem, his royal city, like a bird in a cage. I set up blockades against him and made him dread exiting his city gate. I detached from his land the cities of his that I had plundered and (iv 15) I gave (them) to Mitinti, the king of the city Ashdod, Padî, the king of the city Ekron, and Ṣilli-Bēl, the king of the city Gaza, and (thereby) made his land smaller. To the former tribute, their annual giving, I added the payment (of) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship and imposed (it) upon them.
As for him, Hezekiah, fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed him and, after my (departure), he had the auxiliary forces and his elite troops (iv 25) whom he had brought inside to strengthen the city Jerusalem, his royal city, and who had provided support, along with 30 talents of gold, 800 talents of silver, choice antimony, large blocks of ..., (iv 30) ivory beds, armchairs of ivory, elephant hide(s), elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, every kind of valuable treasure, as well as his daughters, his palace women, male singers, (and) female singers brought into Nineveh, my capital city, and he sent a mounted messenger of his to me to deliver (this) payment and to do obeisance.
On my fourth campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me (iv 40) so that I mustered my numerous troops and ordered the march to the land Bīt-Yakīn. In the course of my campaign, I defeated Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), a Chaldean who lives in the marshes, at the city Bittūtu. (iv 45) As for him, terror of doing battle with me fell upon him and his heart pounded. He fled alone like a lynx and his (hiding) place could not be found.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Bīt-Yakīn. He — Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), whom I had defeated and whose forces I had scattered during my first campaign — (iv 55) became frightened by the clangor of my mighty weapons and my fierce battle array. He flew away like a bird to the city Nagīte-raqqi, which is in the midst of the sea. I brought his brothers, the seed of his father’s house, whom he had abandoned at the shore of the sea, together with the rest of the people of his land, (iv 60) out of the land Bīt-Yakīn, which is in the swamps (and) marshes, and I counted (them) as booty.
Once again I destroyed (and) devastated his cities, (and) turned (them) into ruins. I poured out awe-inspiring brilliance upon his ally, the king of the land Elam.
On my return march, I placed Aššur-nādin-šumi, my first-born son (whom I) raised on my (own) knee, on his lordly throne and entrusted him with the wide land of Sumer and Akkad.
On my fifth campaign: The population of the cities Tumurrum, Šarum, Ezāma, Kibšu, Ḫalbuda, Qūa, (and) Qana, whose dwellings are situated like the nests of eagles, the foremost of birds, (iv 75) on the peak of Mount Nipur, a rugged mountain, and who had not bowed down to the yoke — I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Nipur.
Like a fierce wild bull, with my select bodyguard and my merciless combat troops, I took the lead of them (the soldiers in my camp). (v 1) I proceeded through the gorges of the streams, the outflows of the mountains, (and) rugged slopes in (my) chair. Where it was too difficult for (my) chair, I leapt forward on my (own) two feet like a mountain goat. I ascended the highest peaks against them. (v 5) Where my knees became tired, I sat down upon the mountain rock and drank cold water from a water skin to (quench) my thirst.
I pursued them on the peaks of the mountains and defeated them. I conquered, (v 10) plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire their cities.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road against Maniye, the king of the city Ukku (and) an insubmissive mountain-dweller. (v 15) Before my time, none of the former kings of the past had marched through the untrodden paths (and) difficult trails on account of the rugged mountains. I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Anara and Mount Uppa, mighty mountains, and I myself, in an armchair, with my crack combat troops, (v 20) entered their narrow passes with great difficulty and ascended with a struggle the steep mountain peaks.
He, Maniye, saw the dust cloud (stirred up) by the feet of my troops, then he abandoned the city Ukku, his royal city, and (v 25) fled afar. I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the city Ukku. I brought out of it every kind of possession (and) property, the treasures of his palace, and I counted (it) as booty.
Moreover, I conquered thirty-three cities on the borders of his district and (v 30) carried off from them people, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats. (Then) I destroyed (them), devastated (them), (and) burned (them) with fire.
From the booty of those lands that I had plundered, I conscripted 20,000 archers (and) 15,000 shield bearers and added (them) to my royal contingent. I divided up the rest of the substantial enemy booty like sheep and goats among my entire camp and my governors, (and) the people of my great cult centers.
At that time, Nineveh, the exalted cult center, the city loved by the goddess Ištar in which all of the rituals for gods and goddesses are present; (v 45) the enduring foundation (and) eternal base whose plan had been designed by the stars (lit. “writing”) of the firmament and whose arrangement was made manifest since time immemorial; a sophisticated place (and) site of secret lore in which every kind of skilled craftsmanship, all of the rituals, (v 50) (and) the secret(s) of the lalgar (cosmic subterranean water) are apprehended;
in which since time immemorial earlier kings, my ancestors, before me exercised dominion over Assyria and ruled the subjects of the god Enlil; (but) not one among them had conceived of and put his mind towards increasing the site of the city, (v 55) building wall(s), straightening the streets, or dredging the river (and) planting orchards; nor had any (of them) paid heed to (or) shown interest in the palace inside it, the seat of lordly dwelling whose site had become too small (and) whose construction was inexpert:
(But) as for me, Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria, the performing of this work came to my attention by the will of the gods and I put my mind to it. I forcibly removed the people of Chaldea, Aramean (tribes), the land of the Manneans, the lands Que, Ḫilakku, (and) Philistia, and the city Tyre, who had not submitted to my yoke, then I made them carry baskets (of earth) and they made bricks.
The former palace, which was 360 cubits long, 80 cubits wide opposite the zamû-wall of the ziggurrat, 134 cubits wide opposite the tower of the temple of the goddess Ištar, (v 75) (and) 95 cubits wide opposite the tower of the Bīt-Kidmuri; which earlier kings, my ancestors, had had constructed for their lordly dwelling, but whose construction they had carried out inexpertly:
They quarried mountain sheep colossi of white limestone in the city Tastiate, which is across the Tigris River, to be their (the palatial halls’) gatekeepers. (vi 1) Throughout their entire land they depleted forests of large trees to have boats built. In the month Ayyāru (II), the time of spring floods, they brought (the colossi) across to this side (of the river) with difficulty in magnificent boats. (vi 5) They sank large boats at the quay dock (and then) made their crews struggle (and) strain. With might and main, they struggled to transport (the colossi) and install (them) in their gates.
The Tebilti River, a tempestuous flood (of water) which had flowed from distant days by the side of the palace and which had caused erosion in its foundation when its flood was in full spate (vi 15) (and) had shaken its base:
I tore down that small palace in its entirety, then I changed the course of the Tebilti River, repaired (the effects of) the erosion, and directed its outflow.
In the hidden depths of its subterranean waters I bonded together, with bitumen, reeds below (and) strong mountain stone above, then I raised a plot of land that was 340 cubits long (and) 288 cubits wide out of the Ḫusur River and converted (it) to dry land. (vi 25) I added (it) to the dimensions of the former terrace. I filled in a terrace of 700 large aslu-cubits along (its) longer side, 176 large aslu-cubits along (its) upper, northern shorter side, 268 large aslu-cubits along the inner, shorter side, (which is) opposite (vi 30) the zamû-wall of the shrine behind (the temple of) the goddess Ištar, 443 large aslu-cubits along the other, parallel, inner shorter side, (which is) on the west behind the ziggurrat of the temple of the goddess Ištar, (and) 386 large aslu-cubits (vi 35) along the lower, southern shorter side, (which is) beside the Tigris River. I raised its superstructure 190 courses of brick high.
So that the construction of my palace might be carried out correctly and that my handiwork be completed, at that time, the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar revealed to me the presence of white limestone in the city Balāṭāya. (vi 45) Therein, I quarried mighty mountain sheep colossi, sphinxes, and large stone slabs for the construction of my lordly palace.
In order to prevent the foundation of the terrace from being weakened over the passage of time by cresting flood(s), I surrounded its base with large limestone (slabs and thereby) reinforced its base.
I had a palace of breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, (vi 55) cedar, cypress, juniper, and e lammaku-wood, (a palace that I named) Egalzagdinutukua (“The Palace Without a Rival”), constructed thereon as my royal residence.
I roofed them (the palatial halls) with beams of cedar (and) cypress, whose scent is sweet, product(s) of Mount Amanus (vi 60) (and) the yield of Mount Sirāra, the holy mountains. I fastened bands of shining silver (and) bright copper on magnificent doors of cedar, cypress, (and) juniper and I installed (them) in their gates. (vi 65) I decorated them (the doors) with silver and copper knobbed nails. I adorned the arches, friezes, and all of the copings with baked bricks (glazed in the color of) obsidian (and) lapis lazuli.
For my lordly pleasure, I had a portico, a replica of a Hittite palace, (vi 70) which is called bīt-ḫilā ni in the language of the land Amurru, constructed inside them.
Twelve striding lions of shining copper (and) fierce demeanor, (which were) standing opposite one another, which were skillfully cast through the craftsmanship of the god Ninagal, and which were filled with radiance — upon (those) lion colossi I installed two identical columns that were cast from bronze, (vi 80) together with four large cedar columns, and I positioned cross-beams (upon them) as a cornice for their gates.
I covered ten sphinxes of cast bright urudû-copper with shining zaḫalû-silver and (over them), over ten sphinxes of alabaster, (and) over twelve sphinxes of cast ...-metal I erected two magnificent ebony columns, whose inlays are pašallu-gold, and columns of cedar, cypress, (and) daprānu-juniper with eš marû-silver and bronze inlays, and I positioned the architraves of my lordly palatial halls (on those columns).
Moreover, I made twelve mountain sheep colossi of cast bright urudû-copper, which are splendid in form (and) perfect in shape, two mountain sheep colossi of alabaster, (and) seventy-two mountain sheep colossi and sphinxes of white limestone suitable for holding the door bolt(s) for leaving and entering.
I engraved on slabs of breccia (and) alabaster, and on large limestone slabs (images of) the enemy settlements that I had conquered. I surrounded their (the palace rooms’) lower courses (with them and) made (them) an object of wonder.
I planted alongside it (the palace) a botanical garden, a replica of Mount Amanus, which has all kinds of aromatic plants (and) fruit trees, trees that are the mainstay of the mountains and Chaldea, together with cotton trees (lit. “trees bearing wool”), collected inside it.
Nineveh, the site of whose circumference had been 9,300 cubits since former times (and) for which no earlier ruler had had an inner or outer wall built — I added 12,515 (cubits) in the plain around the city to (its) previous measurement and (thus) established its dimensions as 21,815 large cubits.
I laid the foundation of its great wall, Badnigalbilukurašušu, (which means) “Wall Whose Brilliance Overwhelms Enemies,” upon limestone and made (it) 40 bricks thick. I raised its superstructure 180 courses of brick high.
I had fourteen gates opened up in it in four directions, in front and behind, (and) along both sides, for entering and leaving.
“The God Šarur Is the One Who Cuts Down the King’s Enemy”: (this is) the Ḫandūru Gate. (vii 40) “May the Vice-Regent of the God Aššur Endure”: (this is) the Aššur Gate, which (leads to) the Inner City (Aššur). “The One Who Flattens All Enemies”: (this is) the Sennacherib Gate, which (leads to) the land Ḫalzi. “The God Enlil Is the One Who Makes My Reign Firm”: (vii 45) (this is) the Šamaš Gate, which (leads to) the land Gagal. “O Ištar Bless the One Who Provides for You!”: (this is) the Mullissu Gate, which (leads to) the city Kār-Mullissi. “The One Who Exorcises the ‘Flesh’ of the Asakku-demon”: (this is) the Step Gate. “The Choicest of Grain and Flocks (vii 50) Are Constantly Inside It”: (this is) the gate (that leads to) the city Šibaniba. “The Bearer of the Produce of the Mountains”: (this is) the gate (that leads to) the land Ḫalaḫḫu. In total, eight gates (facing) the rising sun, towards the south and east, (and) I gave them (these) names.
“The God Adad Is the Provider of Prosperity to the Land”: (this is) the Adad Gate, which (leads to) the game preserve. “The God Erra Is the One Who Cuts Down Enemies”: (this is) the Nergal Gate, which (leads to) the city Tarbiṣu. “The God Igisigsig Is the One Who Makes Orchards Flourish”: (vii 60) (this is) the Gate of the Gardens. In total, three gates (facing) towards the north (and) I gave them (these) names.
“The God Ea Is the One Who Properly Directs (Water Flow into) My Cisterns”: (this is) the Mašqû Gate. (vii 65) “The One Who Brings in Income from the Settlements”: (this is) the Quay Gate. “The One Who Regulates Everything”: (this is) the Armory Gate. In total, three gates (facing) towards the west (and) I gave them (these) names.
I opened up a foundation pit for the outer wall, Badnigerimḫuluḫa, (which means) “Terrorizer of Enemies,” then I dug down forty-five nindanu and made (it) reach the water table. I bound together strong mountain stone in the water below and above I expertly carried out its construction with large limestone (blocks) up to its copings.
I enlarged the site of Nineveh, my capital city. I broadened its squares, making (them) as bright as day. I had an inner (and) outer wall built and I raised (them) as high as mountain(s).
So that there would be outflow from the Ḫusur River in the city (and) the passage of water upstream and downstream, I built aqueducts beneath it (the city wall) with baked bricks, ...
I had a bridge constructed opposite the Citadel Gate with paving stones of white limestone for the passage of my lordly chariot.
Beside the city, in a botanical garden (one) pānu (in size and) a garden (one) pānu (in size) for a game preserve, (viii 5) I gathered every type of aromatic tree of the land Ḫatti, fruit trees of all lands, (and) trees that are the mainstay of the mountains and Chaldea. Upstream of the city, on newly tilled soil, (viii 10) I planted vines, every type of fruit tree, and olive trees.
For the expansion of orchards, I subdivided the meadowland upstream of the city into plots of two pānu each for the citizens of Nineveh and I handed (them) over (viii 15) to them. To make (those) planted areas luxuriant, I cut with iron picks a canal straight through mountain and valley, from the border of the city Kisiru to the plain of Nineveh. (viii 20) I caused an inexhaustible supply of water to flow there for a distance of one and a half leagues from the Ḫusur River (and) made (it) gush through feeder canals into those gardens.
I provided irrigation for 500 seeded fields in the high fields of Nineveh with (that) water (and thereby) I made grain and cereals grow high and luxuriantly on ... and in furrows.
I created a marsh to moderate the flow of water for (those) gardens and had a canebrake planted (in it). I let loose in it herons, wild boars (lit. “pigs of the reeds”), (and) roe deer. By divine will, (viii 35) vines, all kinds of fruit trees, olive trees, and aromatic trees flourished greatly in (those) gardens (planted) on newly tilled soil. Cypress trees, musukkannu-trees, (and) all kinds of trees grew tall and sent out shoots. (viii 40) The marshes thrived greatly. Birds of the heavens, heron(s) whose home(s) are far away, made nest(s) and wild boars (and) roe de er gave birth in abundance.
I cut down musukkannu-trees (and) cypress trees grown in the orchards (and) marsh reeds from the swamps and I used (them) in the work required (to build) my lordly palatial halls. (viii 50) They picked cotton (lit. “trees bearing wool”) (and) wove (it) into clothing.
After I had finished the work on my palace, I invited inside it the god Aššur, the great lord, (and) the gods and goddesses living in Assyria, (viii 55) then I made splendid offerings and presented my gift(s). I made fine oil from olives and aromatics from the orchards (planted) on newly tilled soil. (viii 60) At the inauguration of the palace, I had the heads of the subjects of my land drenched (and) I watered their insides with sweet wine.
In the future, may one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur names for shepherding the land and people, renovate its dilapidated section(s) when that wall becomes old and dilapidated. May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, (viii 70) anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Aššur and the goddess Ištar will (then) hear his prayers.
Date Ex. 1 Abu (V), the third day, eponymy of Aššur-bēlu-uṣur, governor of the city Šaḫuppa (695).
Date ex. 2 Araḫsamna (VIII), the ... th day, eponymy of Šulmu-Bēl, governor of the city Talmusu (696).
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), capable shepherd, favorite of the great gods, (i 5) guardian of truth who loves justice, renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (and) strives after good deeds, perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls (i 10) the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning:
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises. He made all of the black-headed (people) from the Upper Sea (i 15) of the Setting Sun to the Lower Sea of the Rising Sun bow down at my feet. Thus did recalcitrant rulers come to fear battle with me. While they were abandoning their settlements, (i 20) they flew away alone like bats (living) in crevices to inaccessible place(s).
On my first campaign, I brought about the defeat of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), together with the troops of (the land) Elam, his allies, (i 25) in the plain of Kish. In the midst of that battle he abandoned his camp, fled alone, and (thereby) saved his life. I seized the chariots, horses, wagons, (and) mules (i 30) that he had abandoned in the thick of battle.
I joyfully entered his palace, which is in Babylon, then I opened his treasury and brought out gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, precious stones, (i 35) all kinds of possessions (and) property without number, a substantial tribute, (together with) his palace women, courtiers, attendants, male singers, female singers, all of the craftsmen, as many as there were, (and) his palace attendants, (i 40) and I counted (them) as booty.
With the strength of the god Aššur, my lord, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered 75 of his fortified cities, fortresses of Chaldea, and 420 small(er) settlements in their environs. (i 45) I brought out the auxiliary forces of the Arameans (and) Chaldeans who were in Uruk, Nippur, Kish, Ḫursagkalama, Cutha, (and) Sippar, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.
On my return march, I defeated all together the Tuʾumuna, Riḫiḫu, Yadaqqu, Ubudu, Gibrê, Malaḫu, Gurumu, Ubulu, (i 55) Damunu, Gambulu, Ḫindaru, Ruʾuʾa, Puqudu, Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu, (i 60) insubmissive Arameans. I carried off into Assyria a substantial booty (consisting of) 208,000 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number.
In the course of my campaign, I received a substantial audience gift from Nabû-bēl-šumāti, the official in charge of the city Ḫararatu: gold, silver, large musukkannu-trees, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats.
I put to the sword the population of the city Ḫirimmu, a dangerous enemy, and I did not spare a single one. I hung their corpses on poles and placed (them) around the city. I reorganized that district (i 75) (and) imposed for eternity one ox, ten sheep, ten homers of wine, (and) twenty homers of dates as his first-fruits offerings to the gods of Assyria, my lords.
On my second campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and I marched to the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians, (i 80) who since time immemorial had not submitted to the kings, my ancestors. In the high mountains, difficult terrain, I rode on horseback and had my personal chariot carried on (men’s) necks. (i 85) In very rugged terrain I roamed about on foot like a wild bull.
I surrounded (and) conquered the cities Bīt-Kilamzaḫ, Ḫardišpu, (and) Bīt-Kubatti, their fortified walled cities. I brought out of them people, horses, mules, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats, (ii 1) and I counted (them) as booty. Moreover, I destroyed, devastated, (and) turned into ruins their small(er) settlements, which were without number. I burned with fire pavilions (and) tents, their abodes, and reduced (them) to ashes.
I made that city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ a fortress again (and) I strengthened its walls more than before, then (ii 10) I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I brought down from the mountains the people of the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians who had fled from my weapons and (ii 15) I made (them) dwell in the cities Ḫardišpu (and) Bīt-Kubatti. I placed them under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Arrapḫa. I had a stele made, had all the victorious conquests that I achieved over them (ii 20) written on it, and I erected (it) in (that) city.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Ellipi. Before my arrival, Ispabāra, their king, (ii 25) abandoned his fortified cities (and) his treasury and fled far away. I overwhelmed all of his wide land like a fog. I surrounded, conquered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Marʾubištu (and) Akkuddu, cities of his royal house, together with thirty-four small(er) settlements in their environs.
I carried off people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats without number, then I brought him (Ispabāra) to nought and (ii 35) made his land smaller. I detached from his land the cities Ṣi(ṣ)ṣirtu (and) Kummaḫlum, fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements in their environs (and) the district of the land Bīt-Barrû in its entirety, and I added (this area) to the territory of Assyria.
I took the city Elenzaš as a royal city and a fortress for that district, then I changed its former name and (ii 45) called it Kār-Sennacherib. I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I placed (it) under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Ḫarḫar, and (thus) enlarged my land.
On my return march, I received a substantial payment from the distant Medes, of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had heard mention. (Thus) I made them bow down to the yoke of my lordship.
On my third campaign, I marched to the land Ḫatti. (ii 60) Fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed Lulî, the king of the city Sidon, and he fled afar into the midst of the sea and disappeared. The awesome terror of the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed the cities Great Sidon, Lesser Sidon, Bīt-Zitti, Ṣarepta, Maḫalliba, Ušû, (ii 65) Akzibu, (and) Acco, his fortified cities (and) fortresses, an area of pasture(s) and water-place(s), resources upon which he relied, and they bowed down at my feet.
I placed Tu-Baʾlu on the royal throne over them and imposed upon him tribute (and) payment (in recognition) of my overlordship (to be delivered) yearly (and) without interruption.
As for Min(u)ḫimmu of the city Samsimuruna, Tu-Baʾlu of the city Sidon, Abdi-Liʾti of the city Arwad, Ūru-Milki of the city Byblos, Mitinti of the city Ashdod, (ii 80) Būdi-il of the city Bīt-Ammon, Kammūsu-nadbi of the land Moab, Aya-rāmu of the land Edom, all of the kings of the land Amurru, they brought extensive gifts, four times (the normal amount), as their substantial audience gift before me and kissed my feet.
Moreover, (as for) Ṣidqâ, the king of the city Ashkelon who had not bowed down to my yoke, I forcibly removed the gods of his father’s house, himself, his wife, his sons, (ii 90) his daughters, his brothers, (and other) offspring of his father’s house and took him to Assyria.
I set Šarru-lū-dāri, son of Rūkibtu, their former king, over the people of the city Ashkelon and imposed upon him the payment of tribute (and) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship so that he (now) pulls my yoke.
In the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Bīt-Daganna, (iii 1) Joppa, Banayabarqa, (and) Azuru, the cities of Ṣidqâ that had not submitted to me quickly.
(As for) the governors, the nobles, and the people of the city Ekron who had thrown Padî, their king who was bound by treaty and oaths to Assyria, into iron fetters and who had handed him over to Hezekiah of the land Judah in a hostile manner, (iii 10) they became frightened on account of the villainous acts they had committed. They formed a confederation with the kings of Egypt (and) the archers, chariots, (and) horses of the king of the land Meluḫḫa, forces without number, and they came to their aid.
In the plain of the city Eltekeh, they sharpened their weapons while drawing up in battleline before me. With the support of the god Aššur, my lord, I fought with them and defeated them. In the thick of battle, I captured alive the Egyptian charioteers and princes (lit. “the sons of the king”), together with the charioteers of the king of the land Meluḫḫa.
I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Eltekeh (and) Tamnâ. I approached the city Ekron and I killed the governors (and) nobles who had committed crime(s) (iii 25) and hung their corpses on towers around the city; I counted the citizens who had committed the criminal acts as booty; (and) I commanded that the rest of them, (those) who were not guilty of crimes or wrongdoing, (iii 30) (to) whom no penalty was due, be allowed to go free.
I brought out Padî, their king, from the city Jerusalem and placed (him) on the lordly throne over them, then I imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
Moreover, (as for) Hezekiah of the land Judah, who had not submitted to my yoke, (iii 40) I surrounded (and) conquered forty-six of his fortified walled cities and small(er) settlements in their environs, which were without number, by having ramps trodden down and battering rams brought up, (iii 45) the assault of foot soldiers, sapping, breaching, and siege engines. I brought out of them 200,150 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number, and I counted (them) as booty.
As for him (Hezekiah), I confined him inside the city Jerusalem, his royal city, like a bird in a cage. I set up blockades against him and (iii 55) made him dread exiting his city gate. I detached from his land the cities of his that I had plundered and I gave (them) to Mitinti, the king of the city Ashdod, (iii 60) Padî, the king of the city Ekron, and Ṣilli-Bēl, the king of the city Gaza, and (thereby) made his land smaller. To the former tribute, their annual giving, I added the payment (of) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship and imposed (it) upon them.
As for him, Hezekiah, fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed him and, after my (departure), he had the auxiliary forces and his elite troops whom he had brought inside to strengthen the city Jerusalem, (iii 70) his royal city, and who had provided support, along with 30 talents of gold, 800 talents of silver, choice antimony, large blocks of ..., ivory beds, armchairs of ivory, elephant hide(s), elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, (iii 75) every kind of valuable treasure, as well as his daughters, his palace women, male singers, (and) female singers brought into Nineveh, my capital city, and he sent a mounted messenger of his to me to deliver (this) payment and to do obeisance.
On my fourth campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me so that I mustered my numerous troops and ordered the march to the land Bīt-Yakīn. (iii 85) In the course of my campaign, I defeated Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), a Chaldean who lives in the marshes, at the city Bittūtu. As for him, terror of doing battle with me fell upon him and (iii 90) his heart pounded. He fled alone like a lynx and his (hiding) place could not be found.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Bīt-Yakīn. He — Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), whom (iv 1) I had defeated (and) whose forces I had scattered during my first campaign — became frightened by the clangor of my mighty weapons and my fierce battle array. He flew away like a bird to the city Nagīte-raqqi, (iv 5) which is in the midst of the sea. I brought his brothers, the seed of his father’s house, whom he had abandoned at the shore of the sea, together with the rest of the people of his land, out of the land Bīt-Yakīn, which is in the swamps (and) marshes, and I counted (them) as booty.
Once again I destroyed (and) devastated his cities, (and) turned (them) into ruins. I poured out awe-inspiring brilliance upon his ally, the king of the land Elam.
On my return march, I placed Aššur-nādin-šumi, my first-born son (whom I) raised on my (own) knee, on his lordly throne and entrusted him with the wide land of Sumer and Akkad.
On my fifth campaign: The population of the cities Tumurrum, Šarum, Ezāma, Kibšu, (iv 20) Ḫalbuda, Qūa, (and) Qana, whose dwellings are situated like the nests of eagles, the foremost of birds, on the peak of Mount Nipur, a rugged mountain, and who had not bowed down to the yoke — I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Nipur.
Like a fierce wild bull, with my select bodyguard and my merciless combat troops, I took the lead of them (the soldiers in my camp). I proceeded through the gorges of the streams, the outflows of the mountains, (and) rugged slopes in (my) chair. (iv 30) Where it was too difficult for (my) chair, I leapt forward on my (own) two feet like a mountain goat. I ascended the highest peaks against them. Where my knees became tired, I sat down upon the mountain rock and drank cold water from a water skin to (quench) my thirst.
I pursued them on the peaks of the mountains and defeated them. I conquered, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire their cities.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road against Maniye, the king of the city Ukku (and) an insubmissive mountain-dweller. Before my time, none of the former kings of the past had marched through the untrodden paths (and) difficult trails on account of the rugged mountains. (iv 45) I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Anara and Mount Uppa, mighty mountains, and I myself, in an armchair, with my crack combat troops, entered their narrow passes with great difficulty and ascended with a struggle the steep mountain peaks.
He, Maniye, saw the dust cloud (stirred up) by the feet of my troops, then he abandoned the city Ukku, his royal city, and fled afar. (iv 55) I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the city Ukku. I brought out of it every kind of possession (and) property, the treasures of his palace, and I counted (it) as booty.
Moreover, I conquered thirty-five cities on the borders of its outskirts and carried off people, oxen, and sheep and goats, (and) donkeys. (Then) I destroyed (them), devastated (them), (and) burned (them) with fire.
In the eponymy of Šulmu-Bēl, governor of the city Talmusu (696), Kirūa — the city ruler of Illubru, a servant who belonged to me, whom his gods had abandoned — (iv 65) incited the population of Ḫilakku to rebel and prepare for battle. The people living in the cities Ingirâ and Tarzu aligned themselves with him, then seized the road through the land Que (and) blocked (its) passage.
I sent against them archers, shield and lance bearers, chariots, (and) horses of my royal contingent. In rugged mountain terrain, they defeated the population of Ḫilakku, who had aligned themselves with him. (iv 75) They conquered and plundered the cities Ingirâ (and) Tarzu.
As for him (Kirūa), they besieged him in the city Illubru, his fortified city, and cut off his escape route. They defeated him by means of bringing up battering rams, siege machines (lit. “ nimgallu s of the wall”), (iv 80) and siege engines, (and) the assault of foot soldiers, and they took possession of the city.
They brought Kirūa, the city ruler, together with booty from his cities and the inhabitants of Ḫilakku who had aligned themselves with him, as well as donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats to Nineveh, before me. I flayed Kirūa.
Once again, I reorganized the city Illubru (and) settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I installed the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord, inside it. (iv 90) I had a stele of alabaster made and I erected (it) in front of it.
In the eponymy of Aššur-bēlu-uṣur, governor of the land Katmuḫu (695), I ... against the city Tīl-Garimme, a city on the border of the land Tabal where Gurdî, king of the city Urdutu, (v 5) had mobilized his weapons, then I sent archers, shield and lance bearers, chariots, (and) horses of my royal contingent against it.
They besieged that city and (v 10) took possession of the city by means of piling up earth, bringing up battering rams, (and) the assault of foot soldiers. They counted the people, as well as the gods, living inside it as booty. They destroyed (and) devastated that city. They turned (it) into a mound of ruins (lit. “a mound and ruins”).
From the booty of those lands that I had plundered, I conscripted 30,000 archers (and) 20,000 shield bearers and added (them) to my royal contingent. (v 20) I divided up the rest of the substantial enemy booty like sheep and goats among my entire camp and my governors, (and) the people of my great cult centers.
At that time, Nineveh, the exalted cult center, the city loved by the goddess Ištar (v 25) in which all of the rituals for gods and goddesses are present; the enduring foundation (and) eternal base whose plan had been designed by the stars (lit. “writing”) of the firmament and whose arrangement was made manifest since time immemorial; (v 30) a sophisticated place (and) site of secret lore in which every kind of skilled craftsmanship, all of the rituals, (and) the secret(s) of the lalgar (cosmic subterranean water) are apprehended;
in which since time immemorial earlier kings, (v 35) my ancestors, before me exercised dominion over Assyria and ruled the subjects of the god Enlil; (but) not one among them had conceived of and put his mind towards increasing the site of the city, building wall(s), straightening the streets, (v 40) or dredging the river (and) planting orchards; nor had any (of them) paid heed to (or) shown interest in the palace inside it, the seat of lordly dwelling whose site had become too small (and) whose construction was inexpert:
(But) as for me, Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria, (v 50) the performing of this work came to my attention by the will of the gods and I put my mind to it. I forcibly removed the people of Chaldea, Aramean (tribes), the land of the Manneans, the lands Que and Ḫilakku, (and) Philistia, and the land (of the city) Tyre, who had not submitted to my yoke, then I made them carry baskets (of earth) and they made bricks.
The former palace, whose extent was 360 cubits on (its) longer side (and) 95 cubits on (its) shorter side, and (v 60) whose site was too small; which earlier kings, my ancestors, had had constructed for their lordly dwelling, but whose construction they had carried out inexpertly:
They quarried bull colossi of white limestone in the city Tastiate, which is across the Tigris River, to be their (the palatial halls’) gatekeepers. Throughout their entire land they depleted forests of large trees to have boats built. (v 70) In the month Ayyāru (II), the time of spring floods, they brought (the colossi) across to this side (of the river) with difficulty in magnificent boats. They sank large boats at the quay dock (and then) made their crews (v 75) struggle (and) strain. With might and main, they struggled to transport (the colossi) and install (them) in their gates.
The Tebilti River, a tempestuous flood (of water) which had flowed from distant days by the side of the palace and which had caused erosion in its foundation when its flood was in full spate (and) had shaken its base:
I tore down that small palace in its entirety. (v 85) I diverted the course of the Tebilti River from the center of the city and directed its outflow into the meadow behind the city.
In a one-half ikû (stretch) of the water’s (natural) course, I bonded together, with bitumen, four large limestone (blocks) and spread marsh reeds and rushes over them. As an addition, I took a plot of land that was 340 cubits long (vi 1) (and) 289 cubits wide from the Ḫusur River and from the plain of the city (and) added (it) to the dimensions of the former terrace. In its (the terrace’s) entirety, I raised its superstructure 190 courses of brick high.
In order to prevent the foundation of the terrace from being weakened over the passage of time by cresting flood(s), (vi 10) I surrounded its base with large limestone (slabs and thereby) reinforced its base. I enlarged the structure of the palace to 700 large cubits along (its) longer side and 440 large cubits along (its) shorter side and (thus) I made its site bigger.
I built palatial halls of gold, silver, (vi 15) bronze, ...-stone, breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, cypress, juniper, elammaku-wood, (and) Indian wood, for my lordly residence, (vi 20) then I had a house with double doors, a replica of a Hittite palace, opposite (its) gates, constructed.
I roofed them (the palatial halls) with beams of cedar (and) cypress, whose scent is sweet, product(s) of Mount Amanus (vi 25) and Mount Sirāra, the holy mountains. I fastened bands of silver (and) copper on doors of cedar, cypress, juniper, (and) Indian wood and I installed (them) in their gates.
In the corridors that are within the papāḫu-chambers, I made openings for latticed windows. At their gates, I stationed apotropaic figures of alabaster (and) elephant ivory, whose folded hands hold poppies, who are laden with pride (and) allure, (vi 35) (and) who are filled with exuberance, and (thus) I made (them) an object of wonder.
The covering of the roof that (hangs) over the corridors — I made their somber atmosphere cheerful, making (them) as bright as day. (vi 40) I decorated them with silver and copper knobbed nails. I adorned the arches, friezes, and all of the copings with baked bricks (glazed in the color of) obsidian (and) lapis lazuli.
So that the construction of my palace might be carried out correctly and that my handiwork be completed, at that time, the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar, who love my priestly service (and) who selected me (lit. “who called my name”), revealed to me a source of long trunks of cedar, (vi 50) which since distant days grew tall and very thick as they stood in seclusion in the Sirāra mountain range.
In the uplands of Mount Ammanāna (northern Anti-Lebanon), they (Aššur and Ištar) disclosed to me the location of alabaster, which in the time of the kings, (vi 55) my ancestors, was too expensive (even) for the pommel of a sword.
Moreover, breccia, as much as is needed (for making) burzigallu-bowls, (a stone) that had never been seen before, (vi 60) revealed itself at Kapridargilâ (“Dargilâ Village”), which is on the border of the city Tīl-Barsip.
Near Nineveh, in the territory of the city Balāṭāya, by divine will, white limestone was discovered in abundance, then I created bull colossi and (other) statues with limbs of alabaster that are sculpted from a single stone, (whose) proportions are perfect, (and) who stand high on their own pedestals; sphinxes of alabaster (vi 70) whose features are exquisite (and) whose bodies shine like a brilliant day; (and) magnificent slabs of breccia. I cut (them) free on both sides from their mountains, then, for the construction of my palace, I had (them) dragged into Nineveh.
I had bull colossi and sphinxes of white limestone created and their forms perfected through the craft of the deity Ninkura, in the territory of the city Balāṭāya.
Since time immemorial, the kings, my ancestors, created copper statues, replicas of their (own) forms, to be erected in temples, and through their manufacture they had exhausted all of the craftsmen. (vi 85) Through ignorance (and) failure to give thought on the matter, they depleted the oil, wax, (and) wool in their lands for the work they desired.
(But) as for me, Sennacherib, the foremost of all rulers, expert in every type of work, regarding large columns of copper (and) striding lion colossi, which none of the kings of the past (who came) before me had cast: (vii 1) with the ingenious mind that the prince, the god Ninšiku, had granted to me (and) taking counsel with myself, I intensively pondered how to perform this work. Then, with my (own) ideas and knowledge, I created a cast work of copper and expertly carried out its artful execution.
By divine will, I created clay mold(s) of tree trunks and date palm(s), (vii 10) the tree of abundance, (of) twelve raging lions, as well as (of) twelve magnificent bull colossi with perfect features (and) twenty-two sphinxes that are coated in allure (and) charm (and) that have pride (and) exuberance (vii 15) heaped upon them, then I poured copper into it. Just like the cast work of (an object weighing only) a half shekel, I perfected their forms.
I made bull colossi with copper features, two of which were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, (and) bull colossi of alabaster, together with bull colossi and sphinxes of white limestone, hold the door bolts of my palatial halls.
I fastened bands of copper and tin on magnificent copper columns, as well as on large cedar columns, which are the product of Mount Amanus, then I installed (them) upon lion colossi and positioned cross-beams (upon them) as a cornice for their gates.
Sphinxes of alabaster, as well as sphinxes of cast urudû-copper that were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, and sphinxes of cast ...-metal, (vii 35) whose features were brilliant: I erected over them columns of ebony, cypress, cedar, daprānu-juniper, juniper, and Indian wood, with pašallu-gold and silver inlays, then (vii 40) I positioned the architraves of the inner rooms of my lordly residence (on those columns).
I surrounded their (the palace rooms’) lower courses with slabs of breccia (and) alabaster, and large limestone slabs (and) made (them) an object of wonder.
In order to be able to draw water by bucket every day, I had bronze wire chains and bronze cables made and, instead of poles, I had tree trunks and date palm(s) of copper placed over wells.
I made those palatial halls beautiful. To be an object of wonder for all of the people, I raised the superstructure of the entire palace. I called it “The Palace Without a Rival.”
I planted alongside it (the palace) a botanical garden, a replica of Mount Amanus, which has all kinds of aromatic plants (and) fruit trees, trees that are the mainstay of the mountains and Chaldea, together with cotton trees (lit. “trees bearing wool”), collected inside it.
Nineveh, the site of whose circumference had been 9,300 cubits since former times (vii 60) (and) for which no earlier ruler had had an inner or outer wall built — I added 12,515 (cubits) in the plain around the city to (its) previous measurement and (thus) established its dimensions as 21,815 large cubits.
I laid the foundation of its great wall, Badnigalbilukurašušu, (which means) “Wall Whose Brilliance Overwhelms Enemies,” upon limestone and made (it) 40 bricks thick. I raised its superstructure 180 courses of brick high.
I had fifteen gates opened up in it in four directions, in front and behind, (and) along both sides, for entering and leaving.
“May the Vice-Regent of the God Aššur Stay in Good Health”: (this is) the Aššur Gate, which (leads to) the Inner City (Aššur). (vii 75) “The One Who Flattens All Enemies”: (this is) the Sennacherib Gate, which (leads to) the land Ḫalzi. “The God Enlil Is the One Who Makes My Reign Firm”: (this is) the Šamaš Gate, which (leads to) the land Gagal. “Make Sennacherib’s Dynasty as Firm as the Position of the Wagon Constellation!”: (this is) the Mullissu Gate, which (leads to) the city Kār-Mullissi. (vii 80) “The One Who Exorcises the ‘Flesh’ of the Asakku-demon”: (this is) the Step Gate. “The Choicest of Grain and Flocks Are Constantly Inside It”: (this is) the gate (that leads to) the city Šibaniba. “The Bearer of the Produce of the Mountains”: (this is) the gate (that leads to) the land Ḫalaḫḫu. In total, seven gates (facing) the rising sun, (vii 85) towards the south and east, (and) I gave them (these) names.
“The God Adad Is the Provider of Prosperity to the Land”: (this is) the Adad Gate, which (leads to) the game preserve. “The God Erra Is the One Who Slaughters Those Hostile to Me”: (vii 90) (this is) the Nergal Gate, which (leads to) the city Tarbiṣu. “The Divine Nannāru Is the One Who Protects My Lordly Crown”: (this is) the Sîn Gate. In total, three gates (facing) towards the north (and) I gave them (these) names.
“The God Ea Is the One Who Properly Directs (Water Flow into) My Cisterns”: (this is) the Mašqû Gate. (vii 95) “The One Who Brings in Income from the Settlements”: (this is) the Quay Gate. “The Presents of the People of Sumuʾel and Tēma (viii 1) Enter Through It”: (this is) the Desert Gate. “The One Who Regulates Everything”: (this is) the Armory Gate. “The God Šarur Is the One Who Cuts Down the King’s Enemy”: (this is) the Ḫandūru Gate. In total, five gates (facing) towards the west (and) I gave them (these) names.
I opened up a foundation pit for the outer wall, Badnigerimḫuluḫa, (which means) “Terrorizer of Enemies,” then I dug down forty-five nindanu and made (it) reach the water table. (viii 10) I bound together strong mountain stone in the water below and above I expertly carried out its construction with large limestone (blocks) up to its copings.
I enlarged the site of Nineveh, my capital city. I broadened its squares, making (them) as bright as day. I had an inner (and) outer wall built and I raised (them) as high as mountain(s).
I had gardens cultivated upstream and downstream of the city. I gathered in them fruit trees of the mountains and of all lands (and) every type of aromatic tree of the land Ḫatti. On newly tilled soil, which is beside the game preserve, (viii 20) I planted in great number all (types) of mountain vine, every type of fruit tree from all over the world, (including) spice and olive trees.
The Ḫusur River, whose waters since time immemorial had been deep and which none of the kings, my ancestors, had confined (i.e., made its water flow through a canal) so that they (the waters of the Ḫusur) poured into the Tigris River:
To make (those) planted areas luxuriant, I dug with picks a canal straight through high ground (and) low ground, from the border of the city Kisiru. (Thus) I provided a regular supply of those waters to the plain of Nineveh and (viii 30) I made (them) gush through small canals into those gardens.
I mounted an expedition to search for water at the foot of Mount Muṣri, then I climbed high and marched with difficulty to the city Elmunaqinnû. I found sources of water in front of the cities Dūr-Ištar, Šibaniba, and Sulu, then (viii 35) I made their narrow openings bigger and turned (them) into springs.
For a course for those waters, I cut through rugged mountains, confined areas, with picks and directed their outflow into the plain of Nineveh. I strengthened their channels like the base of a mountain. (viii 40) I provided a regular supply of those waters in them. (Thus) I forever added (them) as an addition to the waters of the Ḫusur River.
In summer, I enabled all of the orchards to be irrigated. In winter, I annually had water provided to 1,000 seeded fields in the plains upstream and downstream of the city.
I created a marsh to moderate the flow of those waters and planted a canebrake in it. I let loose in it herons, wild boars (lit. “pigs of the reeds”), (and) roe deer. (viii 50) By divine will, vines, all kinds of fruit trees, olive trees, (and) aromatic trees flourished greatly in (those) gardens (planted) on newly tilled soil. Cypress trees, musukkannu-trees, (and) all kinds of trees grew tall and (viii 55) sent out shoots. The marshes thrived greatly. Birds of the heavens, heron(s) whose home(s) are far away, made nest(s) and wild boars (and) roe deer gave birth in abundance.
I cut down musukkannu-trees (and) cypress trees grown in the orchards (and) marsh reeds from the swamps and I used (them) in the work required (to build) my lordly palatial halls. They picked cotton (lit. “trees bearing wool”) (and) wove (it) into clothing.
After I had finished the work on my palace, I invited inside it the god Aššur, the great lord, (and) the gods and goddesses living in Assyria, then I made splendid offerings and (viii 70) presented my gift(s). I made fine oil from olives and aromatics from the orchards (planted) on newly tilled soil. At the inauguration of the palace, (viii 75) I had the heads of the subjects of my land drenched (and) I watered their insides with sweet wine.
In the future, may one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur names for shepherding the land and people, (viii 80) renovate its dilapidated section(s) when that wall becomes old and dilapidated. May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, anoint (it) with oil, (viii 85) make an offering, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Aššur and the goddess Ištar will (then) hear his prayers.
Date Abu (V), eponymy of Ilu-issīya, governor of the city Damascus (694).
favorite of the great gods, guardian of truth who loves justice, renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (and) strives after good deeds, (i 5´) perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning:
... ... I received a substantial audience gift from Nabû-bēl-šumāti, the official in charge of the city Ḫararatu: gold, silver, large musukkannu-trees, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats.
I put to the sword the population of the city Ḫirimmu, a dangerous enemy, and I did not spare a single one. I hung their corpses on poles and placed (them) around the city. (i 10´´) I reorganized that district (and) imposed for eternity one ox, ten sheep, ten homers of wine, (and) twenty homers of dates as his first-fruits offerings to the gods of Assyria, my lords.
On my second campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, (i 15´´) encouraged me and I marched to the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians, who since time immemorial had not submitted to the kings, my ancestors. In the high mountains, difficult terrain, (i 20´´) I rode on horseback and had my personal chariot carried on (men’s) necks. In very rugged terrain I roamed about on foot like a wild bull.
I surrounded (and) conquered the cities Bīt-Kilamzaḫ, Ḫardišpu, (and) Bīt-Kubatti, (i 25´´) their fortified walled cities. I brought out of them people, horses, mules, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats, and I counted (them) as booty. Moreover, (i 30´´) I destroyed, devastated, (and) turned into ruins their small(er) settlements, which were without number. I burned with fire pavilions (and) tents, their abodes, and reduced (them) to ashes.
I made that city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ a fortress again (and) I strengthened its walls more than before, then I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I brought down from the mountains the people of the land of the Kassites
He (Ispabāra) abandoned his fortified cities (and) his treasury and fled far away. I overwhelmed all of his wide land like a fog. I surrounded, conquered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Marʾubištu (and) Akkuddu, (ii 5´) cities of his royal house, together with thirty-four small(er) settlements in their environs.
I carried off people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats without number, then I brought him (Ispabāra) to nought and made his land smaller. I detached from his land the cities Ṣi(ṣ)ṣirtu (and) Kummaḫlum, fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements (ii 15´) in their environs (and) the district of the land Bīt-Barrû in its entirety, and I added (this area) to the territory of Assyria.
I took the city Elenzaš as a royal city (ii 20´) and a fortress for that district, then I changed its former name and called it Kār-Sennacherib. I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. (ii 25´) I placed (it) under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Ḫarḫar, and (thus) enlarged my land.
On my return march, ... ... ...
Moreover, (as for) Ṣidqâ, the king of the city Ashkelon who had not bowed down to my yoke, I forcibly removed the gods of his father’s house, himself, his wife, his sons, his daughters, his brothers, (and other) offspring of his father’s house and took him to Assyria.
I set Šarru-lū-dāri, son of Rūkibtu, their former king, over the people of the city Ashkelon and imposed upon him the payment of tribute (and) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship so that he (now) pulls my yoke.
In the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Bīt-Daganna, Joppa, Banayabarqa, (and) Azuru, the cities of Ṣidqâ that had not submitted to me quickly.
(As for) the governors, the nobles, and the people of the city Ekron ... ...
In the thick of battle, I captured alive the Egyptian charioteers and princes (lit. “the sons of the king”), together with the charioteers of the king of the land Meluḫḫa.
I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Eltekeh (and) Tamnâ. I approached the city Ekron and I killed the governors (and) nobles who had committed crime(s) and (iii 5) hung their corpses on towers around the city; I counted the citizens who had committed the criminal acts as booty; (and) I commanded that the rest of them, (those) who were not guilty of crimes or wrongdoing, (to) whom no penalty was due, be allowed to go free.
I brought out Padî, their king, from the city Jerusalem and placed (him) on the lordly throne over them, then I imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my lordship.
Moreover, (as for) Hezekiah of the land Judah, who had not submitted to my yoke, I surrounded (and) conquered forty-six of his fortified cities, fortresses, and small(er) settlements in their environs, which were without number, by having (iii 20) ramps trodden down and battering rams brought up, the assault of foot soldiers, sapping, breaching, and siege engines. I brought out of them 200,150 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, (iii 25) oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number, and I counted (them) as booty.
As for him (Hezekiah), I confined him inside the city Jerusalem, his royal city, like a bird in a cage. I set up blockades against him and (iii 30) made him dread exiting his city gate. I detached from his land the cities of his that I had plundered
On my fourth campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me so that I mustered my numerous troops and ordered the march to the land Bīt-Yakīn. In the course of my campaign, (iii 5´) I defeated Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), a Chaldean who lives in the marshes, at the city Bittūtu. As for him, terror of doing battle with me fell upon him and his heart pounded. He fled alone like a lynx and his (hiding) place could not be found.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Bīt-Yakīn. He — Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), whom I had defeated and whose forces I had scattered during my first campaign — (iii 15´) became frightened by the clangor of my mighty weapons and my fierce battle array, then dislodged the gods of the (full) extent of his land from their abodes, and loaded (them) onto boats. He flew away like a bird to the city Nagīte-raqqi, which is in the midst of the sea. (iii 20´) I brought his brothers, the seed of his father’s house, whom he had abandoned at the shore of the sea, together with the rest of the people of his land, out of the land Bīt-Yakīn, which is in the swamps and marshes, and I counted (them) as booty.
Once again I destroyed (and) devastated his cities, (and) turned (them) into ruins. I poured out awe-inspiring brilliance upon his ally, the king of the land Elam.
On my return march, I placed Aššur-nādin-šumi, my first-born son (whom I) raised on my (own) knee, on his lordly throne and
On my fifth campaign: The population of the cities Tumurrum, Šarum, Ezāma, Kibšu, Ḫalbuda, Qūa, (and) Qana, whose dwellings are situated like the nests of eagles, the foremost of birds, on the peak of Mount Nipur, a rugged mountain, and who had not bowed down to the yoke — (iii 5´´) I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Nipur.
Like a fierce wild bull, with my select bodyguard and my merciless combat troops, I took the lead of them (the soldiers in my camp). ... ... ...
... ...
I pursued them on the peaks of the mountains and defeated them. I conquered, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire their cities.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road against Maniye, the king of the city Ukku (and) an insubmissive mountain-dweller. Before my time, none of the former kings of the past had marched through the untrodden paths (and) difficult trails on account of the rugged mountains.
... ... ... I bound him (Nergal-ušēzib) with tethering ropes and iron fetters, and brought him to Assyria. I defeated the king of the land Elam, who had aligned himself with him and come to (iv 5´) his aid. I dispersed his forces and scattered his assembled host.
On my seventh campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and I marched to the land Elam. In the course of my campaign, I conquered and plundered the cities Bīt-Ḫaʾiri (and) Raṣā, (iv 10´) cities on the border of Assyria that the Elamites had taken away by force in the time of my ancestors. I had my garrisons stationed (iv 15´) inside them. I brought (those cities) back inside the border of Assyria and placed (them) under the authority of the garrison commander of Dēr.
The cities Bubê, Dunni-Šamaš, Bīt-Risiya, Bīt-Aḫlamê, Dūru, (iv 20´) Dannat-Sulāya, Šilibtu, Bīt-Aṣusi, Kār-Zēra-iqīša, Bīt-Giṣṣi, Bīt-Katpalāni, Bīt-Imbiya, Ḫamānu, Bīt-Arrabi, Burutu, (iv 25´) Dimtu-ša-Sulāya, Dimtu-ša-Mār-bīti-ēṭir, Ḫarri-ašlakê, Rabbāya, Rāsu, Akkabarina, Tīl-Uḫuri, Ḫamrānu, Nadītu,
together with the cities of the passes, namely Bīt-Bunaki, Tīl-Ḫumbi, Dimtu-ša-Dume-ili, Bīt-Ubiya, Baltī-līšir, Taqab-līšir, Ša-nāqidāte, (iv 35´) Masūtu-šaplīti, Sarḫudēri, Ālum-ša-Bēlet-bīti, Bīt-Aḫḫē-iddina,
... ... ... Kudur-Naḫundu (Kudur-Naḫḫunte), the Elamite, heard about the conquest of his cities and fear fell upon him. He brought (the people of) the rest of his cities into fortresses. (iv 5´´) He abandoned the city Madaktu, his royal city, and took the road to the city Ḫaydala, which is in the distant mountains.
I ordered the march to the city Madaktu, his royal city. In the month Tamḫīru, bitter cold set in and a severe rainstorm sent down (iv 10´´) its rain. I was afraid of the rain and snow ... ... ... ... ...
The dust of their feet covered the wide heavens like a heavy cloud in the deep of winter. While drawing up a battleline before me at the city Ḫalulê, which is on the bank of the Tigris River (and) keeping me from the water source, they sharpened their weapons.
I myself prayed to the deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, Nabû, Nergal, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, the gods who support me, for victory over (my) strong enemy and (v 10´) they immediately heeded my prayers (and) came to my aid.
I raged up like a lion, then put on armor (and) placed a helmet suitable for combat on my head. (v 15´) In my anger, I rode quickly in my exalted battle chariot, which lays enemies low. I took in my hand the mighty bow that the god Aššur had granted to me (and) I grasped in my hand an arrow that cuts off life.
I roared loudly like a storm (and) thundered like the god Adad against all of the troops of the wicked enemies. By the command of the god Aššur, the great lord, my lord, I blew like the onset of a severe storm against the enemy on (their) flanks and front lines. (v 25´) With the weapons of the god Aššur, my lord, and my fierce battle array, I turned them back and made them retreat. I shot the troops of the enemy with uṣṣu-arrows (and) mulmul lu-arrows, and pierced all of their corpses like ....
I quickly slaughtered and defeated Ḫumban-undaša, (...)
... I made their blood flow over the broad earth ... ...
I cut off (their) lips and (thus) destroyed their pride. I cut off their hands like the st ems of cucumbers in season.
I received gold (and) shining silver sling straps as their wrist-trappings (and) slashed off their belts with sharp swords. I took away gold (and) silver (decorated) belt-daggers as their waist-trappings.
(As for) the rest of his magnates, including Nabû-šuma-iškun, a son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), (vi 10´) who had raised their arms because they were terrified of doing battle with me, I captured them alive in the thick of battle.
I brought back all together the chariots along with their horses, whose drivers had been killed in the thick of (that) mighty battle and which had themselves been released so that they galloped about on their own.

I enlarged the structure of the palace to nine hundred and ... large cubits along (its) longer side (vii 5) and ... hundred and sixty large cubits along (its) shorter side and (thus) I made its site bigger. Upon it, I filled in a terrace 190 courses of brick high.

I made ... larger than before, had ... built, and raised (it) as high as a mountain. (As for) its ..., which ... baked bricks, (vii 15) I had (it) expertly made through the craft of well-trained master builders.
In order to prevent its foundations from being weakened by rain and snow, I had its base built with large limestone (blocks and thereby) reinforced its base.
I widened its moat 100 large cubits. ... ... ... ... ...
... ... I laid the foundation of its great wall, Badnigalbilukurašušu, (which means) “Wall Whose Brilliance Overwhelms Enemies,” upon limestone and (vii 5´) made (it) 40 bricks thick, measured by my large brick mold. Upwards (to the north) and downwards (to the south), I enlarged its battlements to (a width of) 39 bricks, then I raised its superstructure up high, to its copings, to (a height of) 200 courses of brick, (each of) whose thickness was one-third of a cubit, and (thus) raised (it) as high as a mountain.
I had eighteen gates opened up in it in four directions, in front and behind, (and) along both sides, for entering and leaving.
“The God Šarur Is the One Who Cuts Down the King’s Enemy”: (this is) the Ḫandūru Gate. “May the Vice-Regent of the God Aššur Endure”: (vii 15´) (this is) the Aššur Gate, which (leads to) the Inner City (Aššur). “The One Who Flattens All Enemies”: (this is) the Sennacherib Gate, which (leads to) the land Ḫalzi. “The God Enlil Is the One Who Makes My Reign Firm”: (this is) the Šamaš Gate, which (leads to) the land Gagal. “May Sennacherib’s Dynasty Be as Firm as the Position of the Wagon Constellation!”: (this is) the Mullissu Gate, which (leads to) the city Kār-Mullissi.

(vii 45´) Until I had (it) reach the water table, I dug down into the water forty-five nindanu, then I bound together strong mountain stone below and above I expertly carried out its construction with large limestone (blocks) up to its copings.
I enlarged the site of Nineveh, my capital city. For the course of a royal road, I made its streets fifty-two large cubits wide and (thus) I made (the city) as bright as day. ...
I cut with iron picks a canal straight through mountain and valley, from the border of the city Kisiru to the plain of Nineveh. (Thus) I provided for eternity a regular supply of water from the Ḫusur River to the plain of Nineveh and I made (it) gush through small canals into the gardens (planted) on newly tilled soil.

I annually provided irrigation for 600 fields seeded with grain and cereals (located) upstream and downstream of the city.
I created a marsh to moderate the flow of those waters and planted a canebrake in it. (viii 10´´) I let loose in it herons, wild boars (lit. “pigs of the reeds”), (and) roe deer. By divine will, vines, all kinds of fruit trees, olive trees, (and) aromatic trees flourished greatly in (those) gardens (planted) on newly tilled soil. (Cypress trees, musukkannu-trees, and) all kinds of trees grew tall and sent out shoots. The marshes thrived greatly. (viii 15´´) Birds of the heavens, herons whose home(s) are far away, made nest(s) and wild boars (and) roe deer gave birth in abundance.

After I had finished the work on my palace, (viii 25´´) I invited inside it the god Aššur, the great lord, (and) the gods and goddesses living in Assyria, then I made splendid offerings and presented my gift(s).

May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, (viii 20´´´) anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Aššur and the goddess Ištar will (then) hear his prayers.
The month ..., ... day, eponymy of Bēl-ēmuranni, governor of the city Carchemish (691).
I added ... payment and imposed (it) upon them.
As for him, Hezekiah, fear of my lordly brilliance (i´ 5´) overwhelmed him and he had the auxiliary forces and his elite troops whom he had brought inside the city Jerusalem, his royal city, along with 30 talents of gold, 800 talents of silver, (i´ 10´) every kind of treasure of his palace, as well as his daughters, his palace women, male singers, (and) female singers brought into Nineveh and he sent a mounted messenger of his to me to deliver (this) payment.
On my fourth campaign, I marched to the land Bīt-Yakīn. In the course of my campaign,
... ... no king of the past (who came) before me ... I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Anara and Mount Uppa, mighty mountains, and I myself, in an armchair, with my fighting troops, ascended with a struggle the steep mountain peaks.
He, Maniye, heard about the advance of my expeditionary force, then he abandoned the city Ukku, his royal city, and fled afar. I entered his palace and, (ii´ 10´) as his substantial audience gift, I carried off every kind of possession (and) property, (which) were without number.
I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire his cities, (and) made (them) like ruin hill(s) (created by) the Deluge.
From the booty of those lands, I conscripted 20,400 archers (and) 20,200 shield bearers and added (them) to my royal contingent.
... I ordered the march against them to the land Nagītu. I settled in Nineveh the people of the land Ḫatti plundered by my bows and they skillfully built magnificent ships, (i´ 5´) a product characteristic to their land(s). I gave orders to sailors of the cities Tyre (and) Sidon, (and) the land Io nia, whom I had captured. They (my troops) let (them) sail down the Tigris River with them downstream to the city Opis.
Then, from the city Opis, they lifted them (the boats) up onto dry land and dragged them on rollers to Sip par.
... they became frightened on account of the villainous acts they had committed. They formed a confederation with the kings of Egypt (and) the archers, chariots, (and) horses of the king of the land Meluḫḫa, forces without number.
In the plain of the city Eltekeh, I fought with them and defeated them.
... ... ... He — Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), whom I had defeated during my first campaign — (ii´ 5´) became frightened by the clangor of my mighty weapons and fled to (the city) Nagīte-raqqi, which is in the midst of the sea. I brought his brothers, the seed of his father’s house, whom he had abandoned at the shore of the sea, together with the rest of the people of his land, out of the land Bīt-Yakīn,
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), capable shepherd, favorite of the great gods, guardian of truth (i 5) who loves justice, renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (and) strives after good deeds, perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning:
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises. (i 15) He made all of the black-headed (people) from the Upper Sea of the Setting Sun to the Lower Sea of the Rising Sun bow down at my feet. Thus did recalcitrant rulers come to fear battle with me. While they were abandoning their settlements, they flew away alone like bats (living) in crevices to inaccessible place(s).
On my first campaign, I brought about the defeat of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), together with the troops of (the land) Elam, his allies, in the plain of Kish. In the midst of that battle he abandoned his camp, fled alone, and (thereby) saved his life. (i 25) I seized the chariots, horses, wagons, (and) mules that he had abandoned in the thick of battle.
I joyfully entered his palace, which is in Babylon, then I opened his treasury and brought out gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, (i 30) precious stones, all kinds of possessions (and) property without number, a substantial tribute, (together with) his palace women, courtiers, attendants, male singers, female singers, all of the craftsmen, as many as there were, (and) his palace attendants, and I counted (them) as booty.
With the strength of the god Aššur, my lord, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered 75 of his fortified cities, fortresses of Chaldea, and 420 small(er) settlements in their environs. I brought out the auxiliary forces of the Arameans (and) Chaldeans (i 40) who were in Uruk, Nippur, Kish, Ḫursagkalama, Cutha, (and) Sippar, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.
On my return march, I defeated all together the Tuʾumuna, Riḫiḫu, Yadaqqu, Ubudu, (i 45) Gibrê, Malaḫu, Gurumu, Ubulu, Damunu, Gambulu, Ḫindaru, Ruʾuʾa, Puqudu, Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu, insubmissive Arameans. (i 50) I carried off into Assyria a substantial booty (consisting of) 208,000 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number.
In the course of my campaign, I received a substantial audience gift from Nabû-bēl-šumāti, the official in charge of the city Ḫararatu: gold, silver, large musukkannu-trees, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats.
I put to the sword the population of the city Ḫirimmu, a dangerous enemy, and I did not spare a single one. (i 60) I hung their corpses on poles and placed (them) around the city. I reorganized that district (and) imposed for eternity one ox, ten sheep, ten homers of wine, (and) twenty homers of dates as his first-fruits offerings to the gods of Assyria, my lords.
On my second campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and I marched to the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians, who since time immemorial had not submitted to the kings, my ancestors. In the high mountains, difficult terrain, I rode on horseback and (i 70) had my personal chariot carried on (men’s) necks. In very rugged terrain I roamed about on foot like a wild bull.
I surrounded (and) conquered the cities Bīt-Kilamzaḫ, Ḫardišpu, (and) Bīt-Kubatti, their fortified walled cities. I brought out of them people, horses, (i 75) mules, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats, and I counted (them) as booty. Moreover, I destroyed, devastated, (and) turned into ruins their small(er) settlements, which were without number. I burned with fire pavilions (and) tents, their abodes, and reduced (them) to ashes.
I made that city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ a fortress again (and) I strengthened its walls more than before, then (ii 1) I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I brought down from the mountains the people of the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians who had fled from my weapons and (ii 5) I made (them) dwell in the cities Ḫardišpu (and) Bīt-Kubatti. I placed them under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Arrapḫa. I had a stele made, had all the victorious conquests that I achieved over them written on it, and I erected (it) in (that) city.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Ellipi. Before my arrival, Ispabāra, their king, abandoned his fortified cities (and) his treasury and fled far away. (ii 15) I overwhelmed all of his wide land like a fog. I surrounded, conquered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Marʾubištu (and) Akkuddu, cities of his royal house, together with thirty-four small(er) settlements in their environs.
I carried off people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats without number, then I brought him (Ispabāra) to nought and made his land smaller. I detached from his land the cities Ṣi(ṣ)ṣirtu (and) Kummaḫlum, fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements in their environs (ii 25) (and) the district of the land Bīt-Barrû in its entirety, and I added (this area) to the territory of Assyria.
I took the city Elenzaš as a royal city and a fortress for that district, then I changed its former name and (ii 30) called it Kār-Sennacherib. I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I placed (it) under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Ḫarḫar, and (thus) enlarged my land.
On my return march, I received a substantial payment from the distant Medes, (ii 35) of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had heard mention. (Thus) I made them bow down to the yoke of my lordship.
On my third campaign, I marched to the land Ḫatti. Fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed Lulî, the king of the city Sidon, and (ii 40) he fled afar into the midst of the sea and disappeared. The awesome terror of the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed the cities Great Sidon, Lesser Sidon, Bīt-Zitti, Ṣarepta, Maḫalliba, Ušû, Akzibu, (and) Acco, his fortified cities (and) fortresses, an area of pasture(s) (ii 45) and water-place(s), resources upon which he relied, and they bowed down at my feet.
I placed Tu-Baʾlu on the royal throne over them and imposed upon him tribute (and) payment (in recognition) of my overlordship (to be delivered) yearly (and) without interruption.
As for Min(u)ḫimmu of the city Samsimuruna, Tu-Baʾlu of the city Sidon, Abdi-Liʾti of the city Arwad, Ūru-Milki of the city Byblos, Mitinti of the city Ashdod, (ii 55) Būdi-il of the land Bīt-Ammon, Kammūsu-nadbi of the land Moab, Aya-rāmu of the land Edom, all of the kings of the land Amurru, they brought extensive gifts, four times (the normal amount), as their substantial audience gift before me and kissed my feet.
Moreover, (as for) Ṣidqâ, the king of the city Ashkelon who had not bowed down to my yoke, I forcibly removed the gods of his father’s house, himself, his wife, his sons, his daughters, his brothers, (and other) offspring of his father’s house and took him to Assyria.
I set Šarru-lū-dāri, son of Rūkibtu, their former king, over the people of the city Ashkelon and imposed upon him the payment of tribute (and) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship so that he (now) pulls my yoke.
In the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Bīt-Daganna, Joppa, (ii 70) Banayabarqa, (and) Azuru, the cities of Ṣidqâ that had not submitted to me quickly.
(As for) the governors, the nobles, and the people of the city Ekron who had thrown Padî, their king who was bound by treaty and oaths (ii 75) to Assyria, into iron fetters and who had handed him over to Hezekiah of the land Judah in a hostile manner, they became frightened on account of the villainous acts they had committed. They formed a confederation with the kings of Egypt (and) the archers, chariots, (and) horses (ii 80) of the king of the land Meluḫḫa, forces without number, and they came to their aid.
In the plain of the city Eltekeh, they sharpened their weapons while drawing up in battleline before me. (iii 1) With the support of the god Aššur, my lord, I fought with them and defeated them. In the thick of battle, I captured alive the Egyptian charioteers and princes (lit. “the sons of the king”), together with the charioteers of the king of the land Meluḫḫa.
I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Eltekeh (and) Tamnâ. I approached the city Ekron and I killed the governors (and) nobles who had committed crime(s) and (iii 10) hung their corpses on towers around the city; I counted the citizens who had committed the criminal acts as booty; (and) I commanded that the rest of them, (those) who were not guilty of crimes or wrongdoing, (to) whom no penalty was due, be allowed to go free.
I brought out Padî, their king, from the city Jerusalem and placed (him) on the lordly throne over them, then I imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
Moreover, (as for) Hezekiah of the land Judah, who had not submitted to my yoke, I surrounded (and) conquered forty-six of his fortified cities, (iii 20) fortresses, and small(er) settlements in their environs, which were without number, by having ramps trodden down and battering rams brought up, the assault of foot soldiers, sapping, breaching, and siege engines. I brought out of them 200,150 people, young (and) old, male and female, (iii 25) horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number, and I counted (them) as booty.
As for him (Hezekiah), I confined him inside the city Jerusalem, his royal city, like a bird in a cage. I set up blockades against him and (iii 30) made him dread exiting his city gate. I detached from his land the cities of his that I had plundered and I gave (them) to Mitinti, the king of the city Ashdod, Padî, the king of the city Ekron, and Ṣilli-Bēl, the king of the city Gaza, and (thereby) made his land smaller. (iii 35) To the former tribute, their annual giving, I added the payment (of) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship and imposed (it) upon them (text: “him”).
As for him, Hezekiah, fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed him and, after my (departure), he had the auxiliary forces and his elite troops whom (iii 40) he had brought inside to strengthen the city Jerusalem, his royal city, and who had provided support, along with 30 talents of gold, 800 talents of silver, choice antimony, large blocks of ..., ivory beds, armchairs of ivory, elephant hide(s), elephant ivory, (iii 45) ebony, boxwood, every kind of valuable treasure, as well as his daughters, his palace women, male singers, (and) female singers brought into Nineveh, my capital city, and he sent a mounted messenger of his to me to deliver (this) payment and to do obeisance.
On my fourth campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me so that I mustered my numerous troops and ordered the march to the land Bīt-Yakīn. In the course of my campaign, I defeated Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), a Chaldean who lives in the marshes, at the city Bittūtu. (iii 55) As for him, terror of doing battle with me fell upon him and his heart pounded. He fled alone like a lynx and his (hiding) place could not be found.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Bīt-Yakīn. He — Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), whom (iii 60) I had defeated and whose forces I had scattered during my first campaign — became frightened by the clangor of my mighty weapons and my fierce battle array, then dislodged the gods of the (full) extent of his land from their abodes, and loaded (them) onto boats. (iii 65) He flew away like a bird to the city Nagīte-raqqi, which is in the midst of the sea. I brought his brothers, the seed of his father’s house, whom he had abandoned at the shore of the sea, together with the rest of the people of his land, out of the land Bīt-Yakīn, which is in the swamps and marshes, and I counted (them) as booty.
Once again I destroyed (and) devastated his cities, (and) turned (them) into ruins. I poured out awe-inspiring brilliance upon his ally, the king of the land Elam.
On my return march, I placed Aššur-nādin-šumi, my first-born son (whom I) raised on my (own) knee, on his lordly throne and entrusted him with the wide land of Sumer and Akkad.
On my fifth campaign: The population of the cities Tumurrum, Šarum, Ezāma, Kibšu, Ḫalbuda, Qūa, (and) Qana, whose dwellings are situated like the nests of eagles, the foremost of birds, on the peak of Mount Nipur, a rugged mountain, and who had not bowed down to the yoke — (iii 80) I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Nipur.
Like a fierce wild bull, with my select bodyguard and my merciless combat troops, I took the lead of them (the soldiers in my camp). I proceeded through the gorges of the streams, the outflows of the mountains, (and) rugged slopes in (my) chair. (iv 5) Where it was too difficult for (my) chair, I leapt forward on my (own) two feet like a mountain goat. I ascended the highest peaks against them. Where my knees became tired, I sat down upon the mountain rock and drank cold water from a water skin to (quench) my thirst.
I pursued them on the peaks of the mountains and defeated them. I conquered, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire their cities.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road against Maniye, the king of the city Ukku (and) an insubmissive mountain-dweller. (iv 15) Before my time, none of the former kings of the past had marched through the untrodden paths (and) difficult trails on account of the rugged mountains. I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Anara and Mount Uppa, mighty mountains, and I myself, in an armchair, (iv 20) with my crack combat troops, entered their narrow passes with great difficulty and ascended with a struggle the steep mountain peaks.
He, Maniye, saw the dust cloud (stirred up) by the feet of my troops, then he abandoned the city Ukku, his royal city, and fled afar. I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the city Ukku. I brought out of it every kind of possession (and) property, the treasures of his palace, and I counted (it) as booty.
Moreover, I conquered thirty-three cities on the borders of his district and carried off from them people, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats. (Then) I destroyed (them), devastated (them), (and) burned (them) with fire.
On my sixth campaign: The rest of the people of the land Bīt-Yakīn, who had groveled like onagers before my mighty weapons, dislodged the gods of the (full) extent of their land from their abodes, (iv 35) then crossed the Great Sea of the Rising Sun and set up their residences in the city Nagītu of the land Elam — I crossed over the sea in boats of the land Ḫatti. I conquered the cities Nagītu (and) Nagītu-diʾbina, together with the lands Ḫilmu, Pillatu, and Ḫupapanu, districts of the land Elam.
I carried off the people of the land Bīt-Yakīn, together with their gods and the people of the king of the land Elam, and I did not leave a (single) escapee. I loaded (them) onto boats and brought (them) to this side (of the sea), then I made (them) take the road to Assyria. I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities that are in those districts. I turned (them) into a mound of ruins (lit. “a mound and ruins”).
On my return march, in a pitched battle, I defeated Šūzubu (Nergal-ušēzib), a citizen of Babylon who had taken the lordship of the land of Sumer and Akkad for himself during the confusion in the land. (iv 50) I captured him alive, bound him with tethering ropes and iron fetters, and brought him to Assyria. I defeated the king of the land Elam, who had aligned himself with him and come to his aid. I dispersed his forces and scattered his assembled host.
On my seventh campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and (iv 55) I marched to the land Elam. In the course of my campaign, I conquered (and) plundered the cities Bīt-Ḫaʾiri (and) Raṣā, cities on the border of Assyria that the Elamites had taken away by force in the time of my ancestor(s). I had my garrisons stationed inside them. (iv 60) I brought (those cities) back inside the border of Assyria and placed (them) under the authority of the garrison commander of Dēr.
The cities Bubê, Dunni-Šamaš, Bīt-Risiya, Bīt-Aḫlamê, Dūru, Dannat-Sulāya, Šilibtu, Bīt-Aṣusi, Kār-Zēra-iqīša, Bīt-Giṣṣi, Bīt-Katpalāni, Bīt-Imbiya, (iv 65) Ḫamānu, Bīt-Arrabi, Burutu, Dimtu-ša-Sulāya, Dimtu-ša-Mār-bīti-ēṭir, Ḫarri-ašlakê, Rabbāya, Rāsu, Akkabarina, Tīl-Uḫuri, Ḫamrānu, Nadītu,
together with the cities of the passes, namely Bīt-Bunaki, Tīl-Ḫumbi, Dimtu-ša-Dume-ili, Bīt-Ubiya, Baltī-līšir, Taqab-līšir, Ša-nāqidāte, Masūtu-šaplīti, Sarḫudēri, Ālum-ša-Bēlet-bīti, (iv 75) Bīt-Aḫḫē-iddina, (and) Ilteuba — I surrounded, conquered, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire (those) thirty-four fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements in their environs, which were without number. I made the smoke from their conflagration cover the wide heavens like a heavy cloud.
Kudur-Naḫundu (Kudur-Naḫḫunte), the Elamite, heard about the conquest of his cities and fear fell upon him. He brought (the people of) the rest of his cities into fortresses. He abandoned the city Madaktu, his royal city, and (v 5) took the road to the city Ḫaydala, which is in the distant mountains.
I ordered the march to the city Madaktu, his royal city. In the month Tamḫīru, bitter cold set in and a severe rainstorm sent down its rain. I was afraid of the rain and snow in the gorges, the outflows of the mountains, (so) I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to Nineveh.
At that time, by the command of the god Aššur, my lord, Kudur-Naḫundu (Kudur-Naḫḫunte), the king of the land Elam, did not last three months and suddenly died a premature death. After him, Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), (v 15) who does not have sense or insight, his younger brother, sat on his throne.
On my eighth campaign, after Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk) had rebelled and the citizens of Babylon, evil gallû-demons, had locked the city gates, they plotted to wage war. (v 20) Arameans, fugitives, runaways, murderers, (and) robbers rallied around Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), a Chaldean, a person of lowly status, a coward (lit. “who has no knees”), (and) a servant who belonged to the governor of the city Laḫīru, and they went down into the marshes and incited rebellion.
I besieged him and put him in dire straits. On account of fear and hunger, he fled to the land Elam. When there were conspiracy and treachery against him, he hurried out of the land Elam and entered Šuanna (Babylon). The Babylonians inappropriately placed him (back) on the throne (and) entrusted him with the lordship of the land of Sumer and Akkad.
They (the Babylonians) opened the treasury of Esagil and took out the gold (and) silver of the god Bēl (Marduk) and the goddess Zarpanītu, the property of the temple of their gods. They sent it as a bribe to Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), the king of the land Elam, who does not have sense or insight, (saying): (v 35) “Gather your army, muster your forces, hurry to Babylon, and align yourself with us! Let us put our trust in you.”
That Elamite, whose cities I had conquered and turned into ruins during a previous campaign to the land Elam, (v 40) accepted the bribe from them without thinking, then gathered his troops (and) his forces, inspected (his) chariots (and) wagons, (and) checked his teams (of) horses (and) mules.
The lands Parsuaš, Anzan, Pašeru, (and) Ellipi, the people of Yasil, (v 45) Lakab(e)ra, Ḫarzunu, Dummuqu, Sulāya, (and) Samʾuna, (who was) a son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), the lands Bīt-Adini, Bīt-Amukāni, Bīt-Šilāni, Bīt-Sāla (Bīt-Saʾalli), Larak, the city Laḫīru, the people (of the tribes of the) Puqudu, Gambulu, Ḫalatu, Ruʾuʾa, (v 50) Ubulu, Malaḫu, Rapiqu, Ḫindaru, (and) Damunu, a large host, formed a confederation with him.
In their multitude, they took the road to Akkad and, as they were advancing towards Babylon, they met up with Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), a Chaldean (who is) the king of Babylon, and banded their forces together. Like a spring invasion of a swarm of locusts, they were advancing towards me as a group to do battle. The dust of their feet covered the wide heavens like a heavy cloud in the deep of winter.
While drawing up in battleline before me at the city Ḫalulê, which is on the bank of the Tigris River, (and) keeping me from the water source, they sharpened their weapons.
I myself prayed to the deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, Nabû, Nergal, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, the gods who support me, (v 65) for victory over (my) strong enemy and they immediately heeded my prayers (and) came to my aid.
I raged up like a lion, then put on armor (and) placed a helmet suitable for combat on my head. (v 70) In my anger, I rode quickly in my exalted battle chariot, which lays enemies low. I took in my hand the mighty bow that the god Aššur had granted to me (and) I grasped in my hand an arrow that cuts off life.
I roared loudly like a storm (and) thundered like the god Adad against all of the troops of the wicked enemies. By the command of the god Aššur, the great lord, my lord, I blew like the onset of a severe storm against the enemy on (their) flanks and front lines. With the weapons of the god Aššur, my lord, and my fierce battle array, I turned them back and made them retreat. (v 80) I shot the troops of the enemy with uṣṣu-arrows (and) mulmullu-arrows, and pierced all of their corpses like ...
I quickly slaughtered and defeated Ḫumban-undaša, the herald of the king of the land Elam, a trusted man who leads his troops, his main support, together with his magnates, who wear gold (decorated) belt-daggers and have reddish gold sling straps fastened to their forearms, like fattened bulls restrained with fetters.
I slit their throats like sheep (and thus) cut off their precious lives like thread. Like a flood in full spate after a seasonal rainstorm, I made their blood flow (vi 5) over the broad earth. The swift thoroughbreds harnessed to my chariot plunged into floods of their blood (just) like the river ordeal. The wheels of my war chariot, which lays criminals and villains low, were bathed in blood and gore. (vi 10) I filled the plain with the corpses of their warriors like grass. I cut off (their) lips and (thus) destroyed their pride. I cut off their hands like the stems of cucumbers in season.
I received gold (and) shining silver sling straps as their wrist-trappings (and) slashed off their belts with sharp swords. I took away gold (and) silver (decorated) belt-daggers as their waist-trappings.
(As for) the rest of his magnates, including Nabû-šuma-iškun, a son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), who had raised their arms because they were terrified of doing battle with me, I captured them alive in the thick of battle.
I brought back all together the chariots along with their horses, whose drivers had been killed in the thick of (that) mighty battle and which had themselves been released so that they galloped about on their own. When the second double-hour of the night had passed, I stopped their slaughter.
(As for) him, Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), the king of the land Elam, along with the king of Babylon (and) the sheikhs of Chaldea who marched at his side, terror of doing battle with me overwhelmed them like alû-demons. They abandoned their tents and, in order to save their lives, they trampled the corpses of their troops as they pushed on.
Their hearts throbbed like the pursued young of pigeons, they passed their urine hotly, (and) released their excrement inside their chariots. I ordered my chariots (and) horses to pursue them. Wherever they caught (them), they killed with the sword the runaways amongst them, who had fled for (their) lives.
At that time, after I had completed the palace in the citadel of Nineveh for my royal residence (and) had filled it with luxuriousness to be an object of wonder for all of the people:
The Rear Palace that earlier kings, my ancestors, had had built for the proper running of the military camp, (vi 40) the care of horses, (and) the overseeing of everything — its terrace did not exist, its site had become too small, and its construction was inexpert. With the passage of time, its base had fallen into disrepair, then its foundations had become loose (and) its superstructure had collapsed.
I tore down that palace in its entirety. I took much fallow land from the meadow and plain of the city as an addition (and) I added (it) to (the site). I abandoned the site of the former palace and filled in a terrace in the area of the meadow that I had taken from the river bank. I raised its superstructure 200 courses of brick high.
In a favorable month, on an auspicious day, upon that terrace, with my innate expertise, I had a palatial wing of limestone and cedar in the style of the land Ḫatti and (vi 55) a magnificent palatial wing of Assyrian workmanship, which greatly surpassed the previous one in size and expertise, built through the craft of well-trained master builders, for my lordly residence.
I roofed them with magnificent beams of cedar grown on Mount Amanus, the holy mountain. I fastened bands of bright copper on doors of white cedar and I installed (them) in their gates. I had magnificent bull colossi fashioned from white limestone that was discovered in the territory of the city Balāṭāya and on the right and left I made (them) hold their door bolts.
I greatly enlarged its outer courtyard for the proper administration of the black-headed (people), the inspection of thoroughbred horses, mules, agālu-donkeys, military equipment, chariots, carts, wagons, quivers, bows, and uṣṣu-arrows, every type of implement of war, (and) the submission of teams of horses (and) mules, which have great strength, to the yoke.
I built (and) completed that palace from its foundations to its battlements. I deposited in it inscribed objects bearing my name.
In the future, one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar name for shepherding the land and people — when that palace becomes old and dilapidated, may a future ruler renovate its dilapidated section(s). May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Aššur and the goddess Ištar will (then) hear his prayers.
(As for) the one who alters my inscription or my name, may the god Aššur, the great lord, the father of the gods, become angry with him as if (he were) an enemy. May he take away (his) scepter and (his) throne from him and overthrow his dynasty.
Duʾūzu (IV), eponymy of Gaḫilu, governor of the city Ḫatarikka (689).
Addaru (XII), twentieth day, eponymy of Bēl-ēmuranni, governor of the city Carchemish (691).
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), capable shepherd, favorite of the great gods, guardian of truth who loves justice, (i 5) renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (and) strives after good deeds, perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning:
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises. He made all of the black-headed (people) from the Upper Sea of the Setting Sun to the Lower Sea of the Rising Sun bow down at my feet. (i 15) Thus did recalcitrant rulers come to fear battle with me. While they were abandoning their settlements, they flew away alone like bats (living) in crevices to inaccessible place(s).
On my first campaign, I brought about the defeat of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), together with the troops of (the land) Elam, his allies, (i 20) in the plain of Kish. In the midst of that battle he abandoned his camp, fled alone, and (thereby) saved his life. I seized the chariots, horses, wagons, (and) mules that he had abandoned in the thick of battle.
I joyfully entered his palace, which is in Babylon, then I opened his treasury and brought out gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, precious stones, all kinds of possessions (and) property without number, a substantial tribute, (together with) his palace women, courtiers, attendants, male singers, female singers, all of (i 30) the craftsmen, as many as there were, (and) his palace attendants, and I counted (them) as booty.
With the strength of the god Aššur, my lord, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered 75 of his fortified cities, fortresses of Chaldea, and 420 small(er) settlements in their environs. (i 35) I brought out the auxiliary forces of the Arameans (and) Chaldeans who were in Uruk, Nippur, Kish, Ḫursagkalama, Cutha, (and) Sippar, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.
On my return march, I defeated all together the Tuʾumuna, Riḫiḫu, Yadaqqu, Ubudu, Gibrê, (i 40) Malaḫu, Gurumu, Ubulu, Damunu, Gambulu, Ḫindaru, Ruʾuʾa, Puqudu, Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu, insubmissive Arameans. (i 45) I carried off into Assyria a substantial booty (consisting of) 208,000 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number.
In the course of my campaign, I received a substantial audience gift from Nabû-bēl-šumāti, the official in charge of the city Ḫararatu: gold, silver, (i 50) large mu sukkannu-trees, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats.
I put to the sword the population of the city Ḫirimmu, a dangerous enemy, and I did not spare a single one. I hung their corpses on poles and (i 55) placed (them) around the city. I reorganized that district (and) imposed for eternity one ox, ten sheep, ten homers of wine, (and) twenty homers of dates as his first-fruits offerings to the gods of Assyria, my lords.
On my second campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and I marched to the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians, who since time immemorial had not submitted to the kings, my ancestors. In the high mountains, difficult terrain, I rode on horseback and had my personal chariot carried on (men’s) necks. (i 65) In very rugged terrain I roamed about on foot like a wild bull.
I surrounded (and) conquered the cities Bīt-Kilamzaḫ, Ḫardišpu, (and) Bīt-Kubatti, their fortified walled cities. I brought out of them people, horses, mules, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats, and (i 70) I counted (them) as booty. Moreover, I destroyed, devastated, (and) turned into ruins their small(er) settlements, which were without number. I burned with fire pavilions (and) tents, their abodes, and reduced (them) to ashes.
I made that city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ a fortress again (and) I strengthened its walls more than before, then I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I brought down from the mountains the people of the land of the Kassites (ii 1) and the land of the Yasubigallians who had fled from my weapons and I made (them) dwell in the cities Ḫardišpu (and) Bīt-Kubatti. (ii 5) I placed them under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Arrapḫa. I had a stele made, had all the victorious conquests that I achieved over them written on it, and I erected (it) in (that) city.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Ellipi. Before my arrival, Ispabāra, their king, abandoned his fortified cities (and) his treasury and fled far away. I overwhelmed all of his wide land like a fog. I surrounded, conquered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Marʾubištu (and) Akkuddu, cities of (ii 15) his royal house, together with thirty-four small(er) settlements in their environs.
I carried off people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats without number, then (ii 20) I brought him (Ispabāra) to nought and made his land smaller. I detached from his land the cities Ṣi(ṣ)ṣirtu (and) Kummaḫlum, fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements in their environs (and) the district of the land Bīt-Barrû in its entirety, and I added (this area) to the territory of Assyria.
I took the city Elenzaš as a royal city and a fortress for that district, then I changed its former name and called it Kār-Sennacherib. I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I placed (it) under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Ḫarḫar, and (thus) enlarged my land.
On my return march, I received a substantial payment from the distant Medes, of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had heard mention. (Thus) I made them bow down to the yoke of my lordship.
On my third campaign, I marched to the land Ḫatti. Fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed Lulî, the king of the city Sidon, and he fled afar into the midst of the sea and disappeared. The awesome terror of the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed the cities Great Sidon, Lesser Sidon, Bīt-Zitti, (ii 40) Ṣarepta, Maḫalliba, Ušû, Akzibu, (and) Acco, his fortified cities (and) fortresses, an area of pasture(s) and water-place(s), resources upon which he relied, and they bowed down at my feet.
I placed Tu-Baʾlu on the royal throne over them and imposed upon him tribute (and) payment (in recognition) of my overlordship (to be delivered) yearly (and) without interruption.
As for Min(u)ḫimmu of the city Samsimuruna, Tu-Baʾlu of the city Sidon, Abdi-Liʾti of the city Arwad, (ii 50) Ūru-Milki of the city Byblos, Mitinti of the city Ashdod, Būdi-il of the land Bīt-Ammon, Kammūsu-nadbi of the land Moab, Aya-rāmu of the land Edom, (ii 55) all of the kings of the land Amurru, they brought extensive gifts, four times (the normal amount), as their substantial audience gift before me and kissed my feet.
Moreover, (as for) Ṣidqâ, the king of the city Ashkelon who had not bowed down to my yoke, I forcibly removed the gods of his father’s house, himself, his wife, his sons, his daughters, (ii 60) his brothers, (and other) offspring of his father’s house and took him to Assyria.
I set Šarru-lū-dāri, son of Rūkibtu, their former king, over the people of the city Ashkelon and imposed upon him the payment of tribute (and) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship so that he (now) pulls my yoke.
In the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Bīt-Daganna, Joppa, Banayabarqa, (and) Azuru, the cities of Ṣidqâ that had not submitted to me quickly.
(As for) the governors, the nobles, and the people of the city Ekron (ii 70) who had thrown Padî, their king who was bound by treaty and oaths to Assyria, into iron fetters and who had handed him over to Hezekiah of the land Judah in a hostile manner, they became frightened on account of the villainous acts they had committed. They formed a confederation with the kings of Egypt (and) the archers, chariots, (ii 75) (and) horses of the king of the land Meluḫḫa, forces without number, and they came to their aid.
In the plain of the city Eltekeh, they sharpened their weapons while drawing up in battleline before me. (iii 1) With the support of the god Aššur, my lord, I fought with them and defeated them. In the thick of battle, I captured alive the Egyptian charioteers and princes (lit. “the sons of the king”), together with the charioteers of the king of the land Meluḫḫa.
I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Eltekeh (and) Tamnâ. I approached the city Ekron and I killed the governors (and) nobles who had committed crime(s) and hung their corpses on towers around the city; I counted the citizens who had committed (iii 10) the criminal acts as booty; (and) I commanded that the rest of them, (those) who were not guilty of crimes or wrongdoing, (to) whom no penalty was due, be allowed to go free.
I brought out Padî, their king, from the city Jerusalem and placed (him) on the lordly throne over them, then I imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
Moreover, (as for) Hezekiah of the land Judah, who had not submitted to my yoke, I surrounded (and) conquered forty-six of his fortified cities, fortresses, and small(er) settlements in their environs, which were without number, by having ramps trodden down and battering rams brought up, (iii 20) the assault of foot soldiers, sapping, breaching, and siege engines. I brought out of them 200,150 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number, and I counted (them) as booty.
As for him (Hezekiah), I confined him inside the city Jerusalem, his royal city, like a bird in a cage. I set up blockades against him and made him dread exiting his city gate. I detached from his land the cities of his that I had plundered and I gave (them) to Mitinti, the king of the city Ashdod, Padî, the king of the city Ekron, (iii 30) and Ṣilli-Bēl, the king of the city Gaza, and (thereby) made his land smaller. To the former tribute, their annual giving, I added the payment (of) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship and imposed (it) upon them.
As for him, Hezekiah, fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed him and, after my (departure), he had the auxiliary forces and his elite troops (iii 35) whom he had brought inside to strengthen the city Jerusalem, his royal city, and who had provided support, along with 30 talents of gold, 800 talents of silver, choice antimony, large blocks of ..., ivory beds, armchairs of ivory, elephant hide(s), elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, every kind of valuable treasure, as well as his daughters, (iii 40) his palace women, male singers, (and) female singers brought into Nineveh, my capital city, and he sent a mounted messenger of his to me to deliver (this) payment and to do obeisance.
On my fourth campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me so that I mustered my numerous troops and (iii 45) ordered the march to the land Bīt-Yakīn. In the course of my campaign, I defeated Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), a Chaldean who lives in the marshes, at the city Bittūtu. As for him, terror of doing battle with me fell upon him and his heart pounded. He fled alone like a lynx and his (hiding) place could not be found.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Bīt-Yakīn. He — Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), whom I had defeated and whose forces I had scattered during my first campaign — became frightened by the clangor of my mighty weapons and my fierce battle array, then (iii 55) dislodged the gods of the (full) extent of his land from their abodes, and loaded (them) onto boats. He flew away like a bird to the city Nagīte-raqqi, which is in the midst of the sea. I brought his brothers, the seed of his father’s house, whom he had abandoned at the shore of the sea, together with the rest of the people of his land, out of the land Bīt-Yakīn, which is in the swamps and marshes, and I counted (them) as booty.
Once again I destroyed (and) devastated his cities, (and) turned (them) into ruins. I poured out awe-inspiring brilliance upon his ally, the king of the land Elam.
On my return march, I placed Aššur-nādin-šumi, my first-born son (whom I) raised on my (own) knee, on his lordly throne and entrusted him with the wide land of Sumer and Akkad.
On my fifth campaign: The population of the cities Tumurrum, Šarum, Ezāma, Kibšu, Ḫalbuda, Qūa, (and) Qana, whose dwellings are situated like the nests of eagles, the foremost of birds, on the peak of Mount Nipur, a rugged mountain, and who had not bowed down to the yoke — I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Nipur.
Like a fierce wild bull, with my select bodyguard and my merciless combat troops, I took the lead of them (the soldiers in my camp). I proceeded through the gorges of the streams, the outflows of the mountains, (and) rugged slopes in (my) chair. (iv 1) Where it was too difficult for (my) chair, I leapt forward on my (own) two feet like a mountain goat. I ascended the highest peaks against them. Where my knees became tired, I sat down upon the mountain rock and drank cold water from a water skin to (quench) my thirst.
I pursued them on the peaks of the mountains and defeated them. I conquered, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire their cities.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road against Maniye, the king of the city Ukku (and) an insubmissive mountain-dweller. (iv 10) Before my time, none of the former kings of the past had marched through the untrodden paths (and) difficult trails on account of the rugged mountains. I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Anara and Mount Uppa, mighty mountains, and I myself, in an armchair, (iv 15) with my crack combat troops, entered their narrow passes with great difficulty and ascended with a struggle the steep mountain peaks.
He, Maniye, saw the dust cloud (stirred up) by the feet of my troops, then he abandoned the city Ukku, his royal city, and fled afar. (iv 20) I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the city Ukku. I brought out of it every kind of possession (and) property, the treasures of his palace, and I counted (it) as booty.
Moreover, I conquered thirty-three cities on the borders of his district and carried off from them people, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats. (Then) I destroyed (them), devastated (them), (and) burned (them) with fire.
On my sixth campaign: The rest of the people of the land Bīt-Yakīn, who had groveled like onagers before my mighty weapons, dislodged the gods of the (full) extent of their land from their abodes, then crossed the Great Sea of the Rising Sun and (iv 30) set up their residences in the city Nagītu of the land Elam — I crossed over the sea in boats of the land Ḫatti. I conquered the cities Nagītu (and) Nagītu-diʾbina, together with the lands Ḫilmu, Pillatu, and Ḫupapanu, districts of the land Elam.
I carried off the people of the land Bīt-Yakīn, together with their gods and the people (iv 35) of the king of the land Elam, and I did not leave a (single) escapee. I loaded (them) onto boats and brought (them) to this side (of the sea), then I made (them) take the road to Assyria. I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities that are in those districts. I turned (them) into a mound of ruins (lit. “a mound and ruins”).
On my return march, in a pitched battle, I defeated Šūzubu (Nergal-ušēzib), a citizen of Babylon who had taken the lordship of the land of Sumer and Akkad for himself during the confusion in the land. I captured him alive, bound him with tethering ropes and iron fetters, and brought him to Assyria. I defeated the king of the land Elam, (iv 45) who had aligned himself with him and come to his aid. I dispersed his forces and scattered his assembled host.
On my seventh campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and I marched to the land Elam. In the course of my campaign, I conquered and plundered the cities Bīt-Ḫaʾiri (and) Raṣā, cities on the border of Assyria that (iv 50) the Elamites had taken away by force in the time of my ancestor(s). I had my garrisons stationed inside them. I brought (those cities) back inside the border of Assyria and placed (them) under the authority of the garrison commander of Dēr.
The cities Bubê, Dunni-Šamaš, Bīt-Risiya, Bīt-Aḫlamê, (iv 55) Dūru, Dannat-Sulāya, Šilibtu, Bīt-Aṣusi, Kār-Zēra-iqīša, Bīt-Giṣṣi, Bīt-Katpalāni, Bīt-Imbiya, Ḫamānu, Bīt-Arrabi, Burutu, Dimtu-ša-Sulāya, Dimtu-ša-Mār-bīti-ēṭir, Ḫarri-ašlakê, (iv 60) Rabbāya, Rāsu, Akkabarina, Tīl-Uḫuri, Ḫamrānu, Nadītu,
together with the cities of the passes, namely Bīt-Bunaki, Tīl-Ḫumbi, Dimtu-ša-Dume-ili, Bīt-Ubiya, Baltī-līšir, Taqab-līšir, (iv 65) Ša-nāqidāte, Masūtu-šaplīti, Sarḫudēri, Ālum-ša-Bēlet-bīti, Bīt-Aḫḫē-iddina, (and) Ilteuba — I surrounded, conquered, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire (those) thirty-four fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements in their environs, which were without number. I made the smoke from their conflagration cover the wide heavens like a heavy cloud.
Kudur-Naḫundu (Kudur-Naḫḫunte), the Elamite, heard about the conquest of his cities and fear fell upon him. He brought (the people of) the rest of his cities into fortresses. He abandoned the city Madaktu, his royal city, and took the road to the city Ḫaydala, which is in the distant mountains.
I ordered the march to the city Madaktu, his royal city. In the month Tamḫīru, bitter cold set in and (v 1) a severe rainstorm sent down its rain. I was afraid of the rain and snow in the gorges, the outflows of the mountains, (so) I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to Nineveh.
At that time, by the command of the god Aššur, my lord, Kudur-Naḫundu (Kudur-Naḫḫunte), the king of the land Elam, did not last three months and suddenly died a premature death. After him, Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), who does not have sense or insight, his younger brother, sat on his throne.
On my eighth campaign, after Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk) had rebelled and (v 10) the citizens of Babylon, evil gallû-demons, had locked the city gates, they plotted to wage war. Arameans, fugitives, runaways, murderers, (and) robbers rallied around Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), a Chaldean, a person of lowly status, a coward (lit. “who has no knees”), (and) a servant who belonged to the governor of the city Laḫīru, and they went down into the marshes and incited rebellion.
I besieged him and put him in dire straits. On account of fear and hunger, he fled to the land Elam. When there were conspiracy and treachery against him, he hurried out of the land Elam and (v 20) entered Šuanna (Babylon). The Babylonians inappropriately placed him (back) on the throne (and) entrusted him with the lordship of the land of Sumer and Akkad.
They (the Babylonians) opened the treasury of Esagil and took out the gold (and) silver of the god Bēl (Marduk) (and) the goddess Zarpanītu, the property of the temple of their gods. (v 25) They sent it as a bribe to Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), the king of the land Elam, who does not have sense or insight, (saying): “Gather your army, muster your forces, hurry to Babylon, and align yourself with us! Let us put our trust in you.”
That Elamite, whose cities I had conquered and turned into ruins during a previous campaign to the land Elam, accepted the bribe from them without thinking, then gathered his troops (and) his forces, inspected (his) chariots (and) wagons, (and) checked his teams (of) horses (and) mules.
The lands Parsuaš, Anzan, Pašeru, (and) Ellipi, the people of Yasil, Lakab(e)ra, Ḫarzunu, Dummuqu, Sulāya, (and) Samʾuna, (who was) a son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), the lands Bīt-Adini, Bīt-Amukāni, Bīt-Šilāni, Bīt-Sāla (Bīt-Saʾalli), Larak, the city Laḫīru, (v 40) the people (of the tribes of the) Puqudu, Gambulu, Ḫalatu, Ruʾuʾa, Ubulu, Malaḫu, Rapiqu, Ḫindaru, (and) Damunu, a large host, formed a confederation with him.
In their multitude, they took the road to Akkad and, as they were advancing towards Babylon, they met up with Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), a Chaldean (who is) the king of Babylon, and banded their forces together. Like a spring invasion of a swarm of locusts, they were advancing towards me as a group to do battle. The dust of their feet covered the wide heavens like a heavy cloud in the deep of winter.
While drawing up in battleline before me at the city Ḫalulê, (which is) on the bank of the Tigris River, (and) keeping me from the water source, they sharpened their weapons.
I myself prayed to the deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, Nabû, Nergal, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, the gods who support me, (v 55) for victory over (my) strong enemy and they immediately heeded my prayers (and) came to my aid.
I raged up like a lion, then put on armor (and) placed a helmet suitable for combat on my head. (v 60) In my anger, I rode quickly in my exalted battle chariot, which lays enemies low. I took in my hand the mighty bow that the god Aššur had granted to me (and) I grasped in my hand an arrow that cuts off life.
I roared loudly like a storm (and) thundered like the god Adad against all of the troops of the wicked enemies. (v 65) By the command of the god Aššur, the great lord, my lord, I blew like the onset of a severe storm against the enemy on (their) flanks and front lines. With the weapons of the god Aššur, my lord, and my fierce battle array, I turned them back and made them retreat. I shot the troops of the enemy with uṣṣu-arrows (and) mulmullu-arrows, and pierced all of their corpses like ...
I quickly slaughtered and defeated Ḫumban-undaša, his field marshal, a trusted man who leads his troops, his main support, together with his magnates, who wear gold (decorated) belt-daggers and (v 75) have reddish gold sling straps fastened to their forearms, like fattened bulls restrained with fetters.
I slit their throats like sheep (and thus) cut off their precious lives like thread. (vi 1) Like a flood in full spate after a seasonal rainstorm, I made their blood flow over the broad earth. The swift thoroughbreds harnessed to my chariot plunged into floods of their blood (just) like the river ordeal. (vi 5) The wheels of my war chariot, which lays criminals and villains low, were bathed in blood and gore. I filled the plain with the corpses of their warriors like grass. I cut off (their) lips and (thus) destroyed their pride. I cut off their hands like the stems of cucumbers in season.
I received gold (and) shining silver sling straps as their wrist-trappings (and) slashed off their belts with sharp swords. I took away gold (and) silver (decorated) belt-daggers as their waist-trappings.
(As for) the rest of his magnates, who had raised their arms because they were terrified of doing battle with me, I captured them alive in the thick of battle.
I brought back all together the chariots along with their horses, whose drivers had been killed in the thick of (that) mighty battle and which had themselves been released so that they galloped about on their own. When the second double-hour of the night had passed, I stopped their slaughter.
(As for) him, Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), the king of the land Elam, along with the king of Babylon (and) the sheikhs of Chaldea who marched at his side, terror of doing battle with me overwhelmed them like alû-demons. They abandoned their tents and, in order to save their lives, they trampled the corpses of their troops as they pushed on.
Their hearts throbbed like the pursued young of pigeons, they passed their urine hotly, (and) released their excrement inside their chariots. I ordered my chariots (and) horses to pursue them. Wherever they caught (them), they killed with the sword the runaways amongst them, who had fled for (their) lives.
At that time, the Rear Palace of Nineveh that earlier kings, my ancestors, had had built for the proper running of the military camp, the care of horses, (and) the overseeing of everything — its terrace did not exist and (vi 35) its site had become too small. With the passage of time, its base had fallen into disrepair, then its foundations had become loose (and) its superstructure had collapsed.
I tore down that palace in its entirety. As an addition, I took much land from the meadow and plain of the city (and) I added (it) to (the site). (vi 40) I abandoned the site of the former palace and filled in a terrace in the area that I had taken from the meadow. I raised its superstructure 200 courses of brick high.
In a favorable month, on an auspicious day, upon that terrace, I had a large palatial wing, which greatly surpassed the previous one, built for my royal residence.
I roofed it with magnificent beams of cedar. I fastened bands of bright copper on doors of white cedar and I installed (them) in its gates. I had bull colossi (text “a bull colossus”) fashioned (from) white limestone that was discovered in the territory of the city Balāṭāya and on the right and left I made (them) hold its door bolt(s).
I built (and) completed that palace from its foundations to its battlements. I deposited in it inscribed objects bearing my name.
In the future, one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar name for shepherding the land and (vi 55) people — when that palace becomes old and dilapidated, may a future ruler renovate its dilapidated section(s) when that palace becomes old and dilapidated. May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Aššur and the goddess Ištar will (then) hear his prayers.

Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), capable shepherd, favorite of the great gods, guardian of truth who loves justice, (i 5) renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (and) strives after good deeds, perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning:
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises. He made all of the black-headed (people) from the Upper Sea of the Setting Sun to the Lower Sea of the Rising Sun bow down at my feet. (i 15) Thus did recalcitrant rulers come to fear battle with me. While they were abandoning their settlements, they flew away alone like bats (living) in crevices to inaccessible place(s).
On my first campaign, I brought about the defeat of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), together with the troops of (the land) Elam, his allies, in the plain of Kish. In the midst of that battle he abandoned his camp, fled alone, and (thereby) saved his life. I seized the chariots, horses, ... (i 25) ... ... ... ...
... ... I called it Kār-Sennacherib. I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I placed (it) under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Ḫarḫar, and (thus) enlarged my land.
On my return march, I received a substantial payment from the distant Medes, of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had heard mention. (Thus) I made them bow down to the yoke of my lordship.
The god Adad (and) the goddess Šala, gods of the city Ekallātum whom Marduk-nādin-aḫḫē, king of Ak kad, had taken and brought to Babylon during the reign of Tiglath-pileser (I), king of Assyria — I had (them) brought out of Babylon after 418 years and I returned them to the city Ekallātum, their (proper) place.
I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the city, and (its) buildings, from its foundations to its crenellations. I removed bricks and earth, as much as there was, from the inner (and) outer walls, the temples, (and) the ziggurrat, and (vi 10´) I threw (it) into the Araḫtu River. I dug a canal into the center of that city and (thus) leveled their site with water. I destroyed the outline of its foundations and (thereby) made its destruction surpass that of the Deluge. So that in the future, the site of that city and (its) temples will be unrecognizable, I dissolved it (Babylon) in water and annihilated (it), (making it) like a meadow.
... ... who preceded/goes before ... ... ...
... ... (...) (As for) the rest of his magnates, including Nabû-šuma-iškun, a son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), who had raised their arms because they were terrified of doing battle with me, I captured them alive in the thick of battle.
I brought back all together the chariots along with their horses, whose drivers had been killed in the thick of (that) mighty battle and which had themselves been released so that they galloped about on their own. When the second double-hour of the night had passed, I stopped their slaughter.
(As for) him, Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), the king of the land Elam, along with the king of Babylon (and) the sheikhs of Chaldea
I fastened bands of bright copper on doors of white cedar and I installed (them) in their gates. I had magnificent bull colossi fashioned from white limestone that was discovered in the territory of the city Balāṭāya and on the right and left I made (them) hold their door bolt(s).
I greatly enlarged its outer courtyard for the proper administration of the black-headed (people), the inspection of thoroughbred horses, mules, a gālu-donkeys, military equipment, chariots, carts, wagons, quivers, bows, and uṣṣu-arrows, every type of (ii´ 10´) implement of war, (and) the submission of teams of horses (and) mules, which have great strength, to the yoke.
... ... ... I conquered his (Marduk-apla-iddina II’s) entire land and I counted (his people) as booty. I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire his cities. ... in the city Nagītu, where he was residing, fear of (my lordly) brilliance overwhelmed him and he (Marduk-apla-iddina II) disappeared.
I ruined the city Ḫirimmu and (the land of) the Yasubigallians, ... dānu, (and) the distant Medes and I destroyed their settlements.
I took away the kingship of Lulî, the king of the city Sidon. (i 10´) I placed Tu-Baʾlu on his throne and imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
I ruined the wide district of the land Judah (and) imposed the yoke on Hezekiah, its king.
I put to the sword the people of the city Tumurrum, who live on Mount Nipur, a rugged mountain. I swept over the city Ukku, together with every last one of its settlements, (so that they looked) like a ruin hill (created by) the Deluge.
I struck down with the sword the people of the land Ḫilakku, who live in the mountains.
... ... who/which ... .... In a pitched battle, they captured him (Nergal-ušēzib) alive (and) brought him before me. (ii 5´) At the Citadel Gate of Nineveh, I bound him with a bear ....
(As for) the king of the land Elam, who had come to his (Šūzubu’s) aid, I marched to his land. I surrounded, conquered, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire his fortified cities, his treasury, and small(er) settlements of his in their environs, as far as the pass of (the land) Bīt-Bunaki.
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, (i 5) king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), capable shepherd, (i 10) favorite of the great gods, guardian of truth who loves justice, (i 15) renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (i 20) (and) strives after good deeds, perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, (ii 1) the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning:
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises.
He made all of the black-headed (people) from the Upper Sea of the Setting Sun to the Lower Sea of the Rising Sun bow down at my feet.
I brought out and I counted (them) as booty.
Once again I destroyed (and) devastated his cities,
I forcibly removed the gods of his father’s house, himself, his wife, his sons, his daughters, his brothers, (and other) offspring of his father’s house and took him to Assyria. I set Šarru-lū-dāri, son of Rūkibtu, their former king, over the people of the city Ashkelon (i´ 5´) and imposed upon him the payment of tribute (and) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship so that he (now) pulls my yoke.
In the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Bīt-Daganna, Joppa, Banayabarqa, (and) Azuru, the cities of Ṣidqâ that had not submitted to me quickly. (As for) the governors, the nobles, ...
He (Lulî) fled afar into the midst of the sea and disappeared.

I burned with fire pavilions (and) tents, their abodes, and reduced (them) to ashes.
... ... I took ... as ... and a fortress for that district, then I changed its former name and (i´ 5´) called it Kār-Sennacherib. I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I placed (it) under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Ḫarḫar, and (thus) enlarged my land.
On my return march, I received a substantial payment from the distant Medes, of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had heard mention.
I fought with them and defeated them. In the thick of battle, I captured alive the Egyptian charioteers and princes (lit. “the sons of the king”), together with the charioteers of the king of the land Meluḫḫa.
I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Eltekeh (and) Tamnâ. I approached the city Ekron and I killed the governors (and) nobles who had committed crime(s) and hung their corpses on towers around the city; ... ...
Palace of Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), favorite of the great gods, wise prince, circumspect ruler, shepherd of people, (and) leader of a widespread population, I:
The god Aššur, father of the gods, looked steadfastly upon me among all of the rulers and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises. He gave me a just scepter that widens borders (and) he put in my hand a merciless rod to fell enemies.
In a pitched battle, I overwhelmed like the Deluge Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), the king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), Chaldeans and Arameans, together with the troops of the land Elam, his allies. He (Marduk-apla-iddina II) fled alone to the Sealand, then he collected the gods of the (full) extent of his land, together with the bones of his forefathers from (their) tomb(s), (10) loaded (them and) his people onto boats, and crossed over to the city Nagītu, which is on the other side of the Bitter Sea. In that place, he disappeared.
I conquered his entire land and I counted (his people) as booty. I destroyed, devastated, burned with fire, (and) conquered his cities.
I ruined the city Ḫirimmu and the land of the Yasubigallians, (and) the land Ellipi, and I destroyed its settlements.
I took away the kingship of Lulî, the king of the city Sidon. I placed Tu-Baʾlu on his throne and imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
I ruined the wide district of the land Judah (and) imposed my yoke on Hezekiah, its king.
I put to the sword the people of the city Tumurrum, who live on a rugged mountain (Mount Nipur). I destroyed the city Ukku, together with every one of its settlements, (so that they looked) like a ruin hill (created by) the Deluge.
I struck down with the sword the people of the land Ḫilakku, who live in the mountains. I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire their cities.
I conquered the city Tīl-Garimme, which is on the border of the land Tabal, and turned (it) into ruins.
The cities Nagītu (and) Nagītu-diʾbina, the lands Ḫilmu, Pillatu, (and) Ḫupapanu, districts of the king of the land Elam that are situated on the other shore of the sea, in which the people of the land Bīt-Yakīn — who because of my mighty weapons had dislodged the gods of their land from their abodes (and) had crossed over the sea — had taken up residence inside: I crossed over the sea in boats of the land Ḫatti, which I had built in Nineveh and the city Tīl-Barsip. (25) I conquered and burned with fire the cities in those districts. I carried off the people of the land Bīt-Yakīn and their gods, together with soldiers of the king of the land Elam, and I brought (them) to Assyria.
Afterwards, the Babylonians, who had gone forth with Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan) (and) had fled to (the land) Elam, brought the king of the land Elam to Babylon and he (the king of Elam) placed Šūzubu (Nergal-ušēzib), son of Gaḫul (Gaḫal), on the royal throne over them.
I ordered archers, chariots, (and) horses of my royal contingent to confront (30) the king of the land Elam. They killed many troops, including his son, and he (the king of Elam) retreated. They marched to Uruk (and) carried off the deities Šamaš of Larsa, the Lady of the Rēš-Temple, the Lady of Uruk, Nanāya, Uṣur-amāssa, Bēlet-balāṭi, Kurunam, Kaššītu, (and) Palil, the gods who live in Uruk, together with their property (and) possessions, which are without number.
On their return march, in a pitched battle, they captured Šūzubu (Nergal-ušēzib), the king of Babylon, alive. (35) They threw him into a neck-stock (and) fetters and brought him before me. At the Citadel Gate of Nineveh, I bound him with a bear.
(As for) the king of the land Elam, who had come to the aid of the Babylonians, I marched to his land. I surrounded, conquered, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire his fortified cities, his treasury, and the small(er) settlements in their environs, as far as the pass of the land Bīt-Bunaki.
The king of the land Elam heard about the conquest of his cities and fear fell upon him. (40) He made the rest of the people of his land go up into fortresses. He abandoned the city Madaktu, his royal city, and set out for the city Ḫaydala, which is in the mountains.
I ordered the march to the city Madaktu, his royal city. In the month Ṭebētu (X), bitter cold set in and continuous rain fell, and I was afraid of the snow in the gorges, the outflows of the mountains, (so) I turned around and took the road to Assyria.
Afterwards, the king of the land Elam, the lands Parsuaš, Anzan, (45) Pašeru, (and) Ellipi, the entirety of Chaldea, (and) all of the Arameans, a large host, formed a confederation with him. They met up with the king of Babylon and marched towards me to do battle.
With the strength of the god Aššur, my lord, I fought with them on the plain of the city Ḫalulê (and) defeated them. I put to the sword 150,000 of their combat troops. I took away from them chariots, wagons, (and) their royal tents.
I captured alive in the midst of (that) battle their magnates, including Nabû-šuma-iškun, a son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), who were standing in silver (decorated) chariots, bedecked with gold ..., wear gold (decorated) belt-daggers, and have gold rings fastened to their forearms.
Terror of doing battle with me overwhelmed the king of Babylon and the king of the land Elam. They released their excrement inside their chariots, fled alone, and ran away to their (own) land(s).
At that time, the Rear Palace, which is inside Nineveh, that earlier kings, my ancestors, had had built for the proper running of the military camp, the care of horses, and the overseeing of everything — a terrace for that palace did not exist and its site had become too small, (and its) outer courtyard was not wide enough to have horses show (their) mettle. With the passage of time, its base had fallen into disrepair and its superstructure was tottering.
I tore down that palace in its entirety. (60) As an addition, I took much fallow land from the meadow (and) I added (it) to it. I abandoned the site of the former palace and filled in a terrace in the fallow land that I had taken from the meadow. I raised its superstructure 200 courses of brick high, measured by my large brick mold.
I laid the foundation of my palatial halls upon that terrace. I had a palatial hall of limestone (and) cedar, a replica of a palace of the land Ḫatti, (65) and a magnificent palatial hall of Assyrian workmanship, which greatly surpassed (the previous one) in size and splendor, built for my royal residence.
I greatly enlarged its outer courtyard for making my thoroughbred horses submissive to the yoke and for reviewing the substantial enemy booty that the god Aššur had given to me.
With the exalted strength of the gods, my lords, I sent orders to all the kings of the land Amurru whom they (the gods) had made bow down at my feet. (70) They cut down large beams of cedar on Mount Amanus. They dragged (them) to Nineveh and I roofed them (the palatial halls). I fastened bands of copper on doors of cypress (and) white cedar and I installed (them) in their gates.
I had pendû-stone — whose appearance is as finely granulated as cucumber seeds, considered valuable enough to be an amulet, a stone for speaking (and) being accepted, as well as making storms pass by, (and) keeping illness away from a man, (and) which was brought from the foot of Mount Nipur — and white limestone, which was discovered at the city Balāṭāya, (75) fashioned into bull colossi and I made (them) hold their door bolts.
I erected cedar columns over sphinxes of pendû-stone and I positioned the architraves of that palatial hall of limestone (on those columns).
With the ingenious mind that the lord of wisdom, the god Ninšiku, had granted to me, by divine will, I created clay molds for all of the bronze works that I intended to cast in Nineveh for the requirements of my palatial halls, then I poured copper into them (text “it”) and (80) my handiwork succeeded. Furthermore, I had twin lamassu-colossi of copper bear slabs of pendû-stone. I stationed (them) between the sphinxes, made (them) like battlements, and made (the façade) beautiful.
In the great courtyard below the palatial hall of limestone, I had a pedestal of pendû-stone, breccia, and sābu-stone made for my royal residence. I placed on it four bronze columns that were alloyed with one-sixth tin and I roofed it with cedar crossbeams that were plated with silver.
I made (that) armory extremely large, perfect, (and) splendid. I filled it with luxuriousness to be an object of wonder for all of the people. The surplus payment of all of the lands, (including) that of the distant Medes — from whom none of the kings, my ancestors, had received tribute — together with the wagons, chariots, vehicles of the king of the Elamites, the king of Babylon, and Chaldea that I had captured, along with the countless equipment (90) that I had accumulated: I had (all of these things) carried to the treasury of that palace and brought inside it.
By the command of the god Aššur, father of the gods, and the goddess Mullissu, the queen, may I spend a long time (and) attain very old age in that palace in good health, happiness, and contentment. May my descendants be established therein forever, into the distant future. May the šēdu-spirit(s) who protect life, the god(s) who preserve well-being day and night, never leave it.
... ... ... I carried off the people of the land Bīt-Yakīn and their gods, together with soldiers of the king of the land Elam, and I brought (them) to Assyria.
Afterwards, the Babylonians — ..., who along with Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan) had gr oveled in the face of my mighty weapons during the course of a previous campaign of mine, ... ..., had gone out, and had fled to (the land) Elam — brought ..., the Elamite, to Babylon and he (the king of Elam) placed Šūzubu (Nergal-ušēzib), son of Gaḫul (Gaḫal), on the royal throne over them.
I ordered archers, chariots, (and) horses of my royal contingent to confront (10´) the king of the land Elam. They killed many of his troops, including his son, and he (the king of Elam) retreated. They marched to Uruk (and) carried off the god Šamaš of Larsa (and) the goddess the Lady of Uruk, the go ds living inside it, together with their property (and) possessions, which are without number.
On their return march, in a pitched battle, they took Šūzubu (Nergal-ušēzib), the king of Babylon, alive and brought him before me. At the Citadel Gate of Nineveh, I bound him with a bear.
(As for) the king of the land Elam, who had come to the aid of the Babylonians, I marched to his land. I surrounded, conquered, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire (his) fortified cities, his treasury, and the small(er) settlements in their environs, as far as the pass of the land Bīt-Bunaki.
The king of the land Elam heard about the conquest of his cities and fear fell upon him. He made the rest of the people of his land go up into fortresses. He abandoned the city Madaktu, his royal city, and set out for the city Ḫaydala, which is in the mountains.
I ordered the march to the city Madaktu, his royal city. In the month Ṭebētu (X), bitter cold set in so I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to Assyria.
After my (departure) h e (the king of Elam), in order to (re)settle his district, ... on ruin hills. He brought the rest of the people of his land, who had fled before my weapons, down fr om ... and settled (them) on the alluvium.
... ... I captured the people of his land and counted (them) as booty. I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire his cities.
The Babylonians ... aligned themselves with the king of the land Elam and bowed down at his feet. ... I ordered the march to Šuanna (Babylon). ... ... in lamentation. Fear fell upon them. They opened the treasury of Esagil, sent gold, silver, (and) precious stones as a bribe to the king of the land Elam (Umman-menanu), (and) wrote to him as follows: “Hurry to Babylon and align yourself with us! Let us put our trust in you.”
He, the king of (the land) Elam — the people of whose land I had captured and carried off (and) whose cities I had destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire — had no sense or insight in him (lit. “in his ear”). He accepted the bribe of the Babylonians and ... ... He did not order their work, (but) gathered his army (and) forces.
The lands Parsuaš, Anzan, Pašeru, (and) Ellipi, the entirety of Chaldea, (and) all of the Arameans, a large host, formed a confederation with him. They met up with the king of Babylon (and) the citizens of Babylon (and) Borsippa and they marched towards me to do battle.
With the strength of the god Aššur, my lord, I fought with them on the plain of the city Ḫalulê (and) defeated them. I put to the sword 150,000 of their combat troops. I took away from them chariots, wagons, (and) their royal tents.
I captured alive in the midst of (that) battle their magnates, including Nabû-šuma-iškun, a son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), who were standing in silver (decorated) chariots, bedecked with gold ..., wear gold (decorated) belt-daggers, and have gold rings fastened to their forearms.
Terror of doing battle with me overwhelmed the king of Babylon and the king of the land Elam. They released their excrement inside their chariot(s), fled alone, and ran away to their (own) land(s).
... Teʾelḫu nu, queen of the Arabs, in the middle of the desert ... I took away ... thousand camels from her. She ... with Hazael. Terror of doing battle with me overwhelmed them. They abandoned their tents and fled for (their) lives to the city ... and the city Adummatu.
(As for) the city... and the city Adummatu, which are located in the desert, ... a place of thirst in which there is no pasture (or) watering-place, ... ...
... by having ramps trodden down ... ... and I received their substantial payment ... ... to me.
(As for) the cities Kapānu, ... ... its secret place, (which is) in ... (5´´) ... I carried off Teʾelḫunu, queen of the Arabs, together with her god s, ... ..., pappardilû-stones, pappar mīnu-stones, ... ḫašūru-wood, all types of aromatics, ... ... and kings ... ... I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire those cities.
At that time, my heart prompted me to ... the Rear Palace, which is inside Nineveh. ... alabaster, limestone ... beams of cypress ... silver, bronze, ... ... for review ing substantial enemy booty, ... ... ...
The god Aššur, the great mountain, father of the gods, the one who decrees fates, ..., who deliberates (only) with himself; the gods Anu, Enlil, (and) Ea, ... the designs of heaven and earth, who designates ... ...; the god Sîn (...), the one who constantly renews himself, the pure god whose signs are inscrutable, ..., (5) the one who makes decisions, the one who makes astrological signs known; the god Šamaš, ..., great judge of the great gods, whose lordly splendor overwhelms all of the lands everywhere; the god Adad, canal inspector of heaven (and) earth, ..., the one who brings barley and flax into being, who makes sat tukku-offerings abundant, ...; the god Šamaš, his signs, without whom ... ... (10) (and) no ruler is named; the god Nabû, ... of heaven and earth, controller of harmony, ...; the god Ninurta, heir of the god Enlil, ... ... the one who breaks up mountains ... ...; the goddess Ištar, ... for her great divinity, ...; (and) the Sebetti, (15) the supr eme gods who stand at the side of the king who reveres them and make his weapons prevail over all enemies:
Sennacherib, ...
I received a substantial payment from the distant Medes, of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had heard mention. (Thus) I made them bow down to the yoke of my lordship.
At that time, the temple of ... ..., the temple of the god Sîn, the temple of the goddess Ningal, the temple of the god Šamaš, the temple of the goddess Aya, ..., (rev. 5´) the temple of the goddess the Lady of Nineveh, the gr eat lady, (...) which Ashurnasirpal (II), king of Assyria, son of Tukultī-Ninurta (II), king of Assyria, ... had built — with the passage of time those temples ....
I tore them down and reached their foundation pit (s). I secured their foundations (...) like solid bed rock and I built (and) completed (them) from their foundations to their crenellations.
The great gods, ..., my lords, ... into their shrines .... I graciously settled (them) on their daises ... I offered fattened bulls (and) fattened sheep as sacrifices .... I presented my gift(s) to them and ... before them.
I had all the victorious conquests that I achieved over all of (my) enemies (...) with the support of (...) the great gods, my lords, written upon inscribed objects and for the kings (...), my descendants, I deposited (them) for ever after.
In the future, may a future ruler, when these temples become old and dilapidated, see my inscribed objects, anoint (them) with oil, make an offering, (and) place (them) with inscribed objects bearing his name. The god Aššur will (then) hear his prayers.
Palace of Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), (and) favorite of the great gods:
The god Aššur, father of the gods, looked steadfastly upon me among all of the rulers and he made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises. He gave me a just scepter that widens borders (10) (and) he put in my hand a merciless rod to fell enemies. He made rulers of the four quarters (of the world), from east to west, bow down at my feet and they (now) pull my yoke.
The akītu-house which from the very distant past ... ...
... ... ... the Nergal Gate, which is opposite ... justice, who opens its gate.
I built Ešaḫulezenzagmukam, “House of Joy and Gladness for the Festival of the Beginning of the Year.”
At the time of the festival of the akītu-house (New Year’s house), I celebrate annually inside it with prayer and expressions of my humility (lit. “stroking my nose”) before god and goddess and for my lordly pleasure.
Month Araḫsamna (VIII), eleventh day, eponymy of Nabû-kēnu-uṣur (690).
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), (and) favorite of the great gods:
The god Aššur and the goddess Ištar granted me a weapon without equal and gave me the strength (lit. “opened my arms”) to destroy those hostile to Assyria. With their great support, (10) I constantly directed my troops in safety from east to west and I made all of the rulers who sit on (royal) daises throughout the four quarters (of the world) bow down at my feet and they (now) pull my yoke.
At that time, I enlarged the site of Nineveh, my capital city. I broadened its streets for the course of a royal road and (thus) I made (the city) as bright as day. I had an inner and outer wall skillfully built and I raised (them) as high as mountain(s). I widened its moat 100 large cubits.
So that in the future there would be no diminution of the royal road, I had steles made and they stood on each side, opposite one another. I measured the width of the royal road, as far as the Gate of the Gardens, as fifty-two large cubits.
At any time, when (anyone of) the people living in this city tears down his old house and builds a new one — if the foundation of his house encroaches upon the royal road, he will be hung (lit. “they will hang him”) on a stake over his house.
Palace of Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), favorite of the great gods:
The god Aššur, father of the gods, looked steadfastly upon me among all of the rulers and he made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises.
At that time, the palace in the citadel of Nineveh, which the kings, my ancestors, had had constructed and whose site was too small; alongside of which the Tebilti River had flowed and which had shaken its base when its flood was in full spate:
I tore down that palace in its entirety, (and then) I improved the course of the Tebilti River and directed its outflow.
In its subterranean waters I very firmly bonded reeds below (and) bitumen above with large (blocks of) limestone. I raised a plot of land that was 340 cubits long (and) 289 cubits wide out of the water and converted (it) into an empty lot. I added (it) to the dimensions of the former terrace (and) thereby enlarged the entire terrace to 700 large cubits along (its) longer side and 440 cubits along (its) shorter side. I raised its superstructure 190 courses of brick high.
I built a palace of breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, cypress, juniper, (and) elammaku-wood thereon as my royal residence; (then) I had a portico, a replica of a Hittite palace, constructed opposite (its) gates.
I roofed them (the palatial halls) with beams of cedar (and) cypress. I fastened bands of silver and copper on doors of white cedar (and) cypress and I installed (them) in their gates.
In the corridors, I made openings for latticed windows. At their gates, I stationed apotropaic figures of alabaster (and) elephant ivory. I decorated them with silver and copper knobbed nails. I adorned the arches, friezes, and all of the copings with baked bricks (glazed in the color of) obsidian (and) lapis lazuli.
So that the construction of my palace might be carried out correctly, at that time, the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar, who love my priestly service, revealed to me a source of long trunks of cedar, which since distant days grew thick as they stood in the Sirāra mountain range
In the uplands of Mount Ammanāna (northern Anti-Lebanon), they (Aššur and Ištar) disclosed to me the location of alabaster, which in the time of the kings, my ancestors, was too expensive (even) for the pommel of a sword.
Moreover, breccia, as much as is needed (for making) burzigallu-bowls, (a stone) that had never been seen before, revealed itself at Kapridargilâ (“Dargilâ Village”).
In the territory of the city Balāṭāya, white limestone was discovered in abundance, and (then) I created bull colossi (and) sphinxes of alabaster, and slabs of alabaster, as well as magnificent slabs of breccia. I cut (them) free on both sides from their mountains, and (then), for the construction of my palace, I had (them) dragged into Nineveh.
(As for) the white limestone that was discovered in the territory of the city Balāṭāya, I had (it) made into bull colossi and sphinxes.
By divine will, I created clay mold(s) of tree trunks and date palm(s), (of) twelve raging lions, as well as (of) twelve magnificent bull colossi (and) twenty-two sphinxes, and I poured copper into it. I perfected their form(s).
I made bull colossi of alabaster and copper, two of which were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, (together with) bull colossi and sphinxes of white limestone, hold the door bolts of my palatial halls.
Sphinxes of alabaster and cast urudû-copper with inlays of shining silver, sphinxes of cast ...-metal, as well as twelve raging bronze lions: I erected over them magnificent copper columns (and) large cedar columns, as well as columns of ebony, cypress, daprānu-juniper, (and) tatīdu-wood, with pašallu-gold, silver, and copper inlays, and (then) I positioned cross-beams (upon them) as a cornice for their gates.
I surrounded their (the palace rooms’) lower courses with slabs of breccia (and) alabaster, and large limestone slabs.
In order to be able to draw water by bucket every day, I had bronze wire chains and bronze cables made and, instead of poles, I had tree trunks (and) date palm(s) placed over wells.
I made those palatial halls beautiful. To be an object of wonder for all of the people, I raised the superstructure of the entire palace. I called it the “Palace Without a Rival.”
By the command of the god Aššur, father of the gods, and the goddess Ištar, the queen, may the good šēdu (and) the good lamassu last forever and ever in it (that palace). May they never leave it.
I raised its superstructure in its entirety 190 courses of brick. I enlarged the structure of the palace to 700 large cubits along (its) longer side and 440 large cubits along (its) shorter side and (thus) I made its site bigger.
I built palatial halls of breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, cypress, juniper, (and) elammaku-wood thereon as my lordly residence; (then) I had a portico, a replica of a Hittite palace, constructed opposite (its) gates.
I roofed them (the palatial halls) with beams of cedar (and) cypress. I fastened bands of silver and copper on doors of white cedar (and) cypress and I installed (them) in their gates.
In their corridors, I made openings for latticed windows. At their gates, I stationed apotropaic figures of alabaster (and) elephant ivory, whose hands are folded, who are laden with pride (and) allure, (and) who are filled with exuberance, and (thus) I made (them) an object of wonder.
I decorated them with silver (and) copper knobbed nails. ...
So that the construction of my palace might be carried out correctly and that my handiwork be completed, at that time, the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar, who love my priestly service (and) who selected me (lit. “who called my name”), revealed to me a source of trunks of cedar, which since distant days grew tall and very thick as they stood in seclusion in the Sirāra mountain range.
< In> the uplands of Mount Ammanāna (northern Anti-Lebanon), they (Aššur and Ištar) disclosed to me the location of alabaster, which in the time of the kings, my ancestors, was too expensive (even) for the pommel of a sword.
Moreover, breccia, as much as is needed (for making) burzigallu-bowls, (a stone) that had never been seen before, revealed itself at Kapridargilâ (“Dargilâ Village”).
Near Nineveh, in the territory of the city Balāṭāya, by divine will, white limestone was discovered in abundance, and (then) I created bull colossi (and) sphinxes of alabaster, and slabs of alabaster, as well as magnificent slabs of breccia. I cut (them) free on both sides from their mountains, and (then), for the construction of my palace, I had (them) dragged into Nineveh.
(As for) the white limestone that was discovered in the territory of the city Balāṭāya, I had (it) made into bull colossi and sphinxes, and (then) I made their appearance(s) resplendent.
By divine will (and) with my (own) knowledge, I created clay mold(s) of tree trunks and date palm(s), (of) twelve raging lions, as well as (of) twelve magnificent bull colossi (and) twenty-two sphinxes with perfect form(s), and I poured copper into it. I perfected their form(s).
I made bull colossi of alabaster and copper, two of which were overlaid with za ḫalû-silver, (together with) bull colossi (and) sphinxes of white limestone, hold the door bolts of my lordly palatial halls.
Sphinxes of alabaster and cast urudû-copper with inlays of shining silver, sphinxes of cast ...-metal, as well as twelve raging bronze lions who are endowed with radiance: I erected over them magnificent copper columns (and) large cedar columns, as well as columns of ebony, cypress, daprānu-juniper, (and) tatīdu-wood, with pašallu-gold, silver, and copper inlays, and (then) I positioned cross-beams (upon them) as a cornice for their gates.
I surrounded their (the palace rooms’) lower courses with slabs of breccia (and) alabaster, and large limestone slabs.
In order to be able to draw water by bucket every day, I had bronze wire chains and bronze cables made and, instead of poles, I had tree trunks and date palm(s) placed over wells.
Moreover, for Tašmētu-šarrat, the palace lady, my beloved spouse, whose form the goddess Bēlet-ilī made more perfect than (that of) all (other) women: I had a palatial hall for lovemaking, happiness, and exultation built, and (then) I stationed sphinxes of white limestone in its gates.
By the command of the god Aššur, father of the gods, and the goddess Ištar, the queen, may we both live long and be satisfied with (our) prosperity in these palatial halls in good health and happiness. May the good šēdu (and) the good lamassu surround these palatial halls forever and ever. May they never leave them.
I made (them) an object of wonder.
I decorated them (the doors) with silver and copper knobbed nails. I adorned the arches, friezes, and all of their copings with baked bricks (glazed in the color of) obsidian (and) lapis lazuli.
So that the construction of my palace might be carried out correctly and that my handiwork be completed, at that time, the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar, who love my priestly service (and) who selected me (lit. “who called my name”), revealed to me a source of trunks of cedar, which since distant days grew tall and very thick as they stood in seclusion in the Sirāra mountain range.

I made ... bull colossi and sphinxes of white limestone, hold the door bolts of my palatial halls.
I fastened bands of copper on magnificent copper columns, as well as on large cedar columns, which are the product of Mount Amanus, and (then) I installed (them) upon lion colossi and positioned cross-beams (upon them) as a cornice for their gates.
Sphinxes of alabaster, as well as sphinxes of cast urudû-copper that were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, and sphinxes of cast ...-metal, whose features were brilliant: I erected over them columns of ebony, cypress, cedar, daprānu-juniper, juniper, and tatīdu-wood, with pašallu-gold and silver inlays, and (then) I positioned the architraves of the inner rooms of my lordly residence (on those columns).
I surrounded their (the palace rooms’) lower courses with slabs of breccia (and) alabaster, and large limestone slabs (and) made (them) an object of wonder.

By the command of the god Aššur, father of the gods, and the goddess Ištar, the queen, may the good šēdu (and) the good lamassu last forever and ever in that palace. May they never leave it.
Palace of Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), (and) favorite of the great gods:
The god Aššur, father of the gods, looked steadfastly upon me among all of the rulers and he made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises.
In a pitched battled in the plain of Kish, I repulsed Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), the king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), (and) took away his rulership. I killed with the sword all of the Chaldeans, together with the massed body of Elamite troops, his allies.
I placed Aššur-nādin-šumi, my first-born son (whom I) raised on my (own) knee, on his royal throne and entrusted him with the wide land of Akkad.
I uprooted all of the Aḫlamû (Arameans) (and) Sutians. I put to the sword the inhabitants of the city Ḫirimmu, not sparing (any of) their offspring. I conquered the land of the Yasubigallians, a dangerous enemy. I ruined the land Ellipi and destroyed its settlements.
Moreover, Lulî, the king of the city Sidon, became frightened of doing battle with me, fled to Iadnana (Cyprus), which is in the midst of the sea, and took refuge (there). In that same land, he disappeared on account of the awesome terror of the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord. I placed Tu-Baʾlu on his royal throne and imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
I ruined the wide district of the recalcitrant (and) strong land Judah (and) I made Hezekiah, its king, bow down at my feet so that he (now) pulls my yoke.
I put to the sword the men of the city Tumurrum, who live on Mount Nipur, a rugged mountain. I destroyed the city Ukku, together with every one of its settlements, (so that they looked) like a ruin hill (created by) the Deluge.
At that time, I made the enemy people whom I had captured carry baskets (of earth) and they made bricks.
The palace in the citadel of Nineveh, whose extent was 360 cubits on (its) longer side (and) 95 cubits on (its) shorter side, and whose site was too small; (and) which earlier kings, my ancestors, had had constructed for their lordly dwelling, but whose construction they had carried out inexpertly:
They quarried mountain sheep colossi of white limestone in the city Tastiate to be their (the palatial halls’) gatekeepers. Throughout all of their lands they depleted forests of large trees to have boats built. In the month Ayyāru (II), the time of spring floods, they brought (the colossi) across to this side (of the river) with difficulty in magnificent boats. They sank large boats at the quay dock (and then) made their crews struggle (and) strain. With might and main, they struggled to transport (the colossi) and install (them) in their gates.
The Tebilti River, a tempestuous flood (of water) which had flowed from distant days by the side of the palace (and) had shaken its base when its flood was in full spate:
I tore down that small palace in its entirety, (and then) I changed the course of the Tebilti River (and) directed its outflow.
In its subterranean waters I very firmly bonded reeds below (and) bitumen above with large (blocks of) limestone. I raised a plot of land that was 340 cubits long (and) 289 cubits wide out of the water and converted (it) to dry land. I made the area larger than before, added (it) to the former dimensions of the palace, and raised its superstructure 190 courses of brick high.
In order to prevent its foundation from being weakened over the passage of time by cresting flood(s), I surrounded its base with large limestone (slabs and thereby) reinforced its base. I enlarged the structure of the palace to 7 00 large cubits along (its) longer side and 440 large cubits along (its) shorter side and (thus) I made its site bigger.
I built a palace of breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, cypress, juniper, (and) elammaku-wood, for my lordly residence; then I had a portico, a replica of a Hittite palace, constructed opposite (its) gates.
I roofed them (the palatial halls) with beams of cedar (and) cypress, whose scent is sweet, product(s) of Mount Amanus and Mount Sirāra, the holy mountains.
... Near Nineveh, in the territory of the city Balāṭāya, by divine will, white limestone was discovered in abundance, and (then) I created bull colossi and (other) statues with limbs of alabaster that are sculpted from a single stone, (whose) proportions are perfect, (and) who stand high on their own pedestals; sphinxes of alabaster whose features are exquisite (and) whose bodies shine like a brilliant day; (and) magnificent slabs of breccia. I cut (them) free on both sides from their mountains, and (then), for the construction of my palace, I had (them) dragged into Nineveh.
I had large bull colossi and sphinxes of white limestone created in the territory of the city Balāṭāya and their forms perfected through the craft of the deity Ninkura.
Since time immemorial, the kings, my ancestors, created copper statues, replicas of their (own) forms, to be erected in temples, and through their manufacture they had exhausted all of the craftsmen. Through ignorance (and) failure to give thought on the matter, they depleted the oil, wax, (and) wo ol in their lands for the work they desired.
(But) as for me, Sennacherib, the foremost of all rulers, expert in every type of work, regarding large columns of copper (and) striding lion colossi, which none of the kings of the past (who came) before me had cast: With the ingenious mind that the prince, the god Ninšiku, had granted to me (and) taking counsel with myself, I intensively pondered how to perform this work. Then, with my (own) ideas and knowledge, I created a cast work of copper and expertly carried out its artful execution.
By divine will, I created clay mold(s) of tree trunks and date palm(s), the tree of abundance, (of) twelve raging lions, as well as (of) twelve magnificent bull colossi with perfect features (and) twenty-two sphinxes that are coated in allure and charm (and) that have pride (and) exuberance heaped upon them, and I poured copper into it. Just like the cast work of (an object weighing only) a half shekel, I perfected their form(s).
I made bull colossi with copper features, two of which were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, (and) bull colossi of alabaster, together with bull colossi and sphinxes of white limestone, hold the door bolts of my palatial halls.
I fastened bands of copper on magnificent copper columns, as well as on large cedar columns, which are the product of Mount Amanus, and (then) I installed (them) upon lion colossi and positioned cross-beams (upon them) as a cornice for their gates.
Sphinxes of alabaster, as well as sphinxes of cast urudû-copper that were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, and sphinxes of cast ...-metal, whose features were brilliant: I erected over them columns of ebony, cypress, cedar, daprānu-juniper, juniper, and tatīdu-wood, with pašallu-gold and silver inlays, and (then) I positioned the architraves of the inner rooms of my lordly residence (on those columns).
I surrounded their (the palace rooms’) lower courses with slabs of breccia (and) alabaster, and large limestone slabs (and) made (them) an object of wonder.
In order to be able to draw water by bucket every day, I had bronze wire chains and bronze cables made and, instead of poles, I had tree trunks and date palm(s) placed over wells.
I made those palatial halls beautiful. To be an object of wonder for all of the people, I raised the superstructure of the entire palace. I called it the “Palace Without a Rival.”
I planted alongside it (the palace) a botanical garden, a replica of Mount Amanus, which has all kinds of aromatic plants (and) fruit trees, trees that are the mainstay of the mountains and Chaldea, collected inside it.
To make (those) planted areas luxuriant, I cut with iron picks a canal straight through a mountain, from the border of the city Kisiru to the plain of Nineveh. I caused an inexhaustible supply of water to flow there for a distance of one and a half leagues from the Ḫusur River (and) made (it) gush through feeder canals into those planted areas.
I created a marsh to moderate the flow of water for (those) gardens and planted a canebrake in it. I let loose in it herons, wild boars (lit. “pigs of the reeds”), (and) roe deer. By divine will, vines and all kinds of fruit trees, olive trees, (and) aromatic trees flourished greatly in (those) gardens. Cypress trees, mu sukkannu-trees, (and) all kinds of trees grew tall and sent out shoots. The marshes thrived greatly. Birds of the heavens, heron(s), made nest(s) and wild boars (and) roe d eer gave birth in abundance.
I cut down musukkannu-trees (and) cypress trees grown in the orchards (and) marsh reeds from the swamps and I used (them) in the work required (to build) my lordly palatial halls.
After I had finished the work on my palace, I invited inside it (the god) Aššur, the great lord, (and) the gods and goddesses living in Assyria, and (then) I made splendid offerings and presented my gift(s). I made fine oil from olives and aromatics. At the inauguration of the palace, I had the heads of the subjects of my land drenched (and) I watered their insides with sweet wine.
By the command of (the god) Aššur, father of the gods, and the goddess Ištar, the queen, may the good šēdu (and) the good lamassu last forever and ever in that palace. May they never leave it.
Palace of Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), favorite of the great gods, wise prince, circumspect ruler, shepherd of the people, (and) leader of a widespread population, I:
The goddess Bēlet-ilī, the lady of creation, looked steadfastly upon me and created my features (while I was still) in the womb of the mother who gave birth to me. Moreover, the god Ninšiku gave me wide understanding equal to (that of) the sage Adapa (and) endowed me with broad knowledge.
The god Aššur, father of the gods, made all of the black-headed (people) bow down at my feet (and) elevated me for shepherding the land and people. He gave me a just scepter that widens the land (and) he put in my hand a merciless weapon to fell enemies.
At that time, I made the enemy people whom I had captured carry baskets (of earth) and they made bricks.
The palace in the citadel of Nineveh, whose extent was 360 cubits on (its) longer side (and) 95 cubits on (its) shorter side, and whose site was too small; (and) which earlier kings, my ancestors, had had constructed for their lordly dwelling, but whose construction they had carried out inexpertly:
They quarried mountain sheep colossi of white limestone in the city Tastiate to be their (the palatial halls’) gatekeepers. Throughout all of their lands they depleted forests of large trees to have boats built. In the month Ayyāru (II), the time of spring floods, they brought (the colossi) across to this side (of the river) with difficulty in magnificent boats. They sank large boats at the quay dock (and then) made their crews struggle (and) strain. With might and main, they struggled to transport (the colossi) and install (them) in their gates.
The Tebilti River, a tempestuous flood (of water) which had flowed from distant days by the side of the palace (and) had shaken its base when its flood was in full spate:
I tore down that small palace in its entirety, (and then) I changed the course of the Tebilti River (and) directed its outflow.
In its subterranean waters I very firmly bonded reeds below (and) bitumen above with large (blocks of) limestone. I raised a plot of land that was 554 cubits long (and) 289 cubits wide out of the water and converted (it) to dry land. I made the area larger than before, added (it) to the former dimensions of the palace, and raised its superstructure 190 courses of brick high.
In order to prevent its foundation from being weakened over the passage of time by cresting flood(s), I surrounded its base with large limestone (slabs and thereby) reinforced its base. I enlarged the structure of the palace to 914 large cubits along (its) longer side and 440 large cubits along (its) shorter side and (thus) I made its site bigger.
I built a palace of breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, cypress, juniper, (and) elammaku-wood, for my lordly residence; then I had a portico, a replica of a Hittite palace, constructed opposite (its) gates.
I roofed them (the palatial halls) with beams of cedar (and) cypress, whose scent is sweet, product(s) of Mount Amanus and Mount Sirāra, the holy mountains. I fastened bands of silver (and) copper on doors of cedar, cypress, (and) juniper and I installed (them) in their gates.
In the corridors that are within the papāḫu-chambers, I made openings for latticed windows. At their gates, I stationed apotropaic figures of alabaster (and) elephant ivory, whose folded hands hold poppies, who are laden with pride (and) allure, (and) who are filled with exuberance, and (thus) I made (them) an object of wonder.
The covering of the roof that (hangs) over the corridors — I made their somber atmosphere cheerful, making (them) as bright as day. I decorated them with silver and copper knobbed nails. I adorned the arches, friezes, and all of their copings with baked bricks (glazed in the color of) obsidian (and) lapis lazuli.
So that the construction of my palace might be carried out correctly and that my handiwork be completed, at that time, the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar, who love my priestly service (and) who selected me (lit. “who called my name”), revealed to me a source of trunks of cedar, which since distant days grew tall and very thick as they stood in seclusion in the Sirāra mountain range.
In the uplands of Mount Ammanāna (northern Anti-Lebanon), they (Aššur and Ištar) disclosed to me the location of alabaster, which in the time of the kings, my ancestors, was too expensive (even) for the pommel of a sword.
Moreover, breccia, as much as is needed (for making) burzigallu-bowls, (a stone) that had never been seen before, revealed itself at Kapridargilâ (“Dargilâ Village”), which is on the border of the city Tīl-Barsip.
Near Nineveh, in the territory of the city Balāṭāya, by divine will, white limestone was discovered in abundance, and (then) I created bull colossi and (other) statues with limbs of alabaster that are sculpted from a single stone, (whose) proportions are perfect, (and) who stand high on their own pedestals; sphinxes of alabaster whose features are exquisite (and) whose bodies shine like a brilliant day; (and) magnificent slabs of breccia.

By the command of the god Aššur, father of the gods, and the goddess Ištar, the queen, may the good šēdu (and) the good lamassu last forever and ever in that palace. May they never leave it.
Palace of Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), (and) favorite of the great gods:
The god Aššur, father of the gods, looked steadfastly upon me among all of the rulers and he made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises.
In a pitched battled, I repulsed Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), the king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), (and) took away his rulership. I killed with the sword all of the Chaldeans, together with the massed body of Elamite troops, his allies.
I placed Aššur-nādin-šumi, my first-born son, on his royal throne and entrusted him with the wide land of Akkad.
I uprooted all of the Aḫlamû (Arameans) (and) Sutians. I put to the sword the inhabitants of the city Ḫirimmu, not sparing (any of) their offspring. I conquered (the land of) the Yasubigallians, a dangerous enemy. I ruined the land Ellipi and destroyed its settlements.
Moreover, Lulî, the king of the city Sidon, became frightened of doing battle with me, fled to Iadnana (Cyprus), which is in the midst of the sea, and took refuge (there). In that same land, he disappeared on account of the awesome terror of the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord. I placed Tu-Baʾlu on his royal throne and imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
I ruined the wide district of the recalcitrant (and) strong land Judah (and) I made Hezekiah, its king, bow down at my feet.
I put to the sword the men of the city Tumurrum, who live on Mount Nipur, a rugged mountain. I destroyed the city Ukku, together with every one of its settlements, (so that they looked) like a ruin hill (created by) the Deluge.
I slaughtered the people of the land Ḫilakku, who live in the high mountains, like sheep. I conquered the city Tīl-Garimme, which is on the border of the land Tabal, and turned (it) into ruins.
The inhabitants of Chaldea, who had become frightened by my battle array, and (then) had dislodged the gods of their entire land from their abodes, had crossed the sea, and had taken up residence inside the city Nagiatu (Nagītu) — I crossed the sea after them in boats of the land Ḫatti. (30) I conquered the cities Nagiatu (Nagītu), Nagiatu-diʾbina (Nagītu-diʾbina), Ḫilmu, Pillatu, and Ḫupapanu, districts on the other shore of the Bitter Sea, and (then) I carried off the people of Chaldea, together with their gods, (and) the people of the king of the land Elam. I did not leave (behind) a (single) escapee.
At that time, I made the enemy people whom I had captured carry baskets (of earth) and they made bricks.
The palace in the citadel of Nineveh, whose extent was 360 cubits on (its) longer side (and) 95 cubits on (its) shorter side, and whose site was too small; alongside of which the Tebilti River had flowed, (35) caused erosion in its foundations, (and) shaken its base; (and) which earlier kings, my ancestors, had had constructed for their lordly dwelling, but whose construction they had carried out inexpertly:
I tore down that small palace in its entirety. I diverted < the course of> the Tebilti River from the center of the city and directed its outflow into the meadow behind the city.
In the hidden depths of its subterranean waters I very firmly bonded reeds below (and) bitumen above with large (blocks of) limestone. I raised a plot of land that was 554 cubits long (and) 289 cubits wide out of the water and converted (it) into an empty lot. (40) I added (it) to the former dimensions of the terrace, and raised its superstructure in its entirety 190 courses of brick. I enlarged the structure of the palace to 914 large cubits along (its) longer side and 440 large cubits along (its) shorter side and (thus) I made its site bigger.
I built palatial halls of gold, silver, bronze, ......-stone, breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, cypress, juniper, elammaku-wood, (and) Indian wood, for my lordly residence; then I had a house with double doors, a replica of a Hittite palace, constructed opposite (its) gates.
I roofed them (the palatial halls) with beams of cedar (and) cypress. I fastened bands of silver (and) copper on doors of white cedar (and) cypress and I installed (them) in their gates.
In the corridors, I made openings for latticed windows. At their gates, I stationed apotropaic figures of alabaster (and) elephant ivory, whose hands are folded, and (thus) I made (them) an object of wonder.
I decorated them with silver (and) copper knobbed nails. I adorned the arches, friezes, and all of their copings with baked bricks (glazed in the color of) obsidian (and) lapis lazuli.

Near Nineveh, in the territory of the city Balāṭāya, by divine will, white limestone was discovered in abundance, and (then) I created bull colossi of alabaster that are sculpted from a single stone, (whose) proportions are perfect; sphinxes of alabaster whose features are exquisite (and) whose bodies shine like a brilliant day; (and) magnificent slabs of breccia. I cut (them) free on both sides from their mountains, and (then), for the construction of my palace, I had (them) dragged into Nineveh.
I had large bull colossi and sphinxes of white limestone created in the territory of the city Balāṭāya and their forms perfected through the craft of the deity Ninkura.
By divine will, I created clay mold(s) of tree trunks together with date palm(s), the tree of abundance, (of) twelve raging lions, as well as (of) twelve magnificent bull colossi with perfect features (and) twenty-two sphinxes that are coated in allure and charm (and) that have pride (and) exuberance heaped upon them, and I poured copper into it. Just like the cast work of (an object weighing only) a half shekel, I perfected their form(s).
I made bull colossi with copper features, two of which were overlaid with zaḫa lû-silver, (and) bull colossi of alabaster, together with bull colossi (and) sphinxes of white limestone, hold the door bolts of my palatial halls.
I fastened bands of copper on magnificent copper columns, as well as on large cedar columns, which are the product of Mount Amanus, and (then) I installed (them) upon lion colossi and positioned cross-beams (upon them) as a cornice for their gates.
Sphinxes of alabaster, as well as sphinxes of cast urudû-copper that were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, and sphinxes of cast ...-metal, whose features were brilliant: I erected over them columns of ebony, cypress, cedar, daprānu-juniper, juniper, and Indian wood, with pašallu-gold and silver inlays, and (then) I positioned the architraves of the inner rooms of my lordly residence (on those columns).
I surrounded their (the palace rooms’) lower courses with slabs of breccia (and) alabaster, and large limestone slabs (and) made (them) an object of wonder.

By the command of the god Aššur, father of the gods, and the goddess Ištar, the queen, may the good šēdu (and) the good lamassu last forever and ever in that palace. May they never leave it.
a dangerous enemy. I ruined the land Ellipi and destroyed its settlements. Moreover, Lulî, the king of the city Sidon, became frightened of doing battle with me, fled like a fish to Iadnana (Cyprus), which is in the midst of the sea, and took refuge (there). In that same land, he disappeared on account of the awesome terror of the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord. I placed Tu-Baʾlu on his royal throne and imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
I ruined the wide district of the ... land Judah (and) ...
Palace of Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), the wise (and) capable favorite of the great gods, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning:
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises. He made all of the rulers of the (four) quarters (of the world) from the Upper Sea of the Setting Sun to the Lower Sea of the Rising Sun bow down at my feet.
On my first campaign, I brought about the defeat of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), together with the troops of (the land) Elam, his allies, in the plain of Kish. He, in order to save his (own) life, fled alone, and (then) I seized the chariots, wagons, horses (and) mules that he had abandoned.
I entered his palace, which is in Babylon, and (then) I opened his treasury and carried off gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, precious stones, the possessions (and) property of his palace.
I captured and plundered his strong cities (and) the fortresses of Chaldea, together with the small(er) settlements in their environs. On my return march, I defeated and plundered the Aramaens (living) on the banks of the Tigris River (and) the Euphrates River.
In the course of my campaign I received a substantial payment from the official in charge of the city Ḫararatu. I put to the sword the population of the city Ḫirimmu, a dangerous enemy, and I did not spare a single one. I reorganized that city (and) imposed one ox, ten sheep, ten homers of wine, (and) twenty homers of dates as his first-fruits offerings to the gods of Assyria.
On my second campaign, I marched to the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians. In the mountains, difficult terrain, I rode on horseback. In very rugged terrain I roamed about on foot like a wild bull.
I conquered and plundered the cities Bīt-Kilamzaḫ, Ḫardišpu, (and) Bīt-Kubatti, their fortified walled cities. Moreover, I destroyed (and) devastated their small(er) settlements, which were without number. I burned with fire pavilions (and) their tents.
I made that city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ a fortress again, and (then) I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I placed them under the authority of the governor of the city Arrapḫa.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Ellipi. Before my arrival, Ispabāra, their king, abandoned his fortified cities and fled far away. I conquered and plundered the cities Marʾubištu (and) Akkuddu, cities of his royal house, together with small(er) settlements in their environs, (and then) I destroyed (them), devastated (them), (and) burned (them) with fire. I conquered the cities Ṣi(ṣ)ṣirtu (and) Kummaḫlum, fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements in their environs. I detached from his land the district of the land Bīt-Barrû in its entirety, and I added (this area) to the territory of Assyria.
I took the city Elenzaš as a fortress for that district, (and then) I changed its (former) name and called it Kār-Sennacherib. I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I placed (it) under the authority of the governor of the city Ḫarḫar.
On my return march, I received a substantial payment from the distant Medes, of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had heard mention. (Thus) I made them bow down to my yoke.
On my third campaign, I marched to the land Ḫatti. Fear of my brilliance overwhelmed Lulî, the king of the city Sidon, and he fled from the city Tyre to Iadnana (Cyprus), which is in the midst of the sea, and disappeared. I placed Tu-Baʾlu on the royal throne and imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
In the plain of the city Ušû, the kings of the land Amurru brought their substantial tribute before me.
Moreover, (as for) Ṣidqâ, the king of the city Ashkelon who had not submitted to my yoke, I forcibly removed the gods of his father’s house, himself, together with his family, and took him to Assyria.
I set Šarru-lū-dāri, son of Rūkibtu, their former king, over the people of the city Ashkelon and imposed upon him the payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
In the course of my campaign, I plundered the cities of his (Ṣidqâ’s) that had not submitted to me. (As for) the governors and the people of the city Ekron who had thrown Padî, their king who was bound by treaty to Assyria, into iron fetters and who had handed him over to Hezekiah of the land Judah, they became frightened on account of the villainous acts they had committed. They formed a confederation with the kings of Egypt (and) the archers, chariots, (and) horses of the king of the land Meluḫḫa, forces without number.
In the plain of the city Eltekeh, I fought with them and defeated them. I captured alive the Egyptian charioteers and princes (lit. “the sons of the king”), together with the charioteers of the king of the land Meluḫḫa.
I approached the city Ekron and I killed with the sword the governors who had committed crime(s); I counted the citizens who had committed the crimes as booty; (and) I commanded that the rest of them, (those) who were not guilty of wrongdoing, be allowed to go free.
I brought out Padî, their king, from the city Jerusalem and placed (him) on the throne over them, and (then) I imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
(As for) Hezekiah of the land Judah, < who> had not submitted to my yoke, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered forty-six of his fortified walled cities and settlements in their environs, which were without number. I counted (them) as booty.
As for him (Hezekiah), I confined him inside the city Jerusalem, his royal city, like a bird in a cage. I set up blockades against him. I detached from his land the cities of his that I had plundered and I gave (them) to the kings of the cities Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, (and) Gaza, and (thereby) made his land smaller. To the former tribute, their annual giving, I added the payment (of) gifts and imposed (it) upon them.
As for him, Hezekiah, fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed him and, he had the auxiliary forces and his elite troops whom he had brought inside the city Jerusalem, his royal city, along with 30 talents of gold, 800 talents of silver, every kind of treasure of his palace, as well as his daughters, his palace women, male singers, (and) female singers brought into Nineveh and he sent a mounted messenger of his to me to deliver (this) payment.
On my fourth campaign, I marched to the land Bīt-Yakīn. In the course of my campaign, I defeated Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), a Chaldean who lives in the marshes, at the city Bittūtu. As for him, he became frightened of my weapons, and (then) he fled alone and his (hiding) place could not be found.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Bīt-Yakīn. He — Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), whom I had defeated during my first campaign — became frightened by the clangor of my mighty weapons. He fled to the city Nagītu, which is in the midst of the sea. I carried off his brothers, the seed of his father’s house, whom he had abandoned at the shore of the sea, (together with) the rest of the people of his land, out of the land Bīt-Yakīn, which is in the swamps and marshes. Once again I destroyed (and) burned with fire his cities. On my return march, I placed Aššur-nādin-šumi, my son, on his lordly throne and entrusted him (with the land of Sumer and Akkad).
On my fifth campaign: The men of the city Tumurrum, whose dwellings are situated like the nests of eagles, on the peak of Mount Nipur, a rugged mountain, and who had not bowed down to my yoke — I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Nipur.
Like a fierce wild bull, with my merciless combat troops, I took the lead of them (the soldiers in my camp). I proceeded through the gorges (and) the rugged mountain slopes in (my) chair. Where it was too difficult for (my) chair, I leapt forward on my (own) two feet like a mountain goat. Where my knees gave out (and) became tired, I sat down upon the mountain rock and drank cold water from a water skin to (quench) my thirst.
I pursued them on the peaks of the mountains and defeated them. I conquered, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire their cities.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road against Maniye, the insubmissive king of the city Ukku. None of the kings of the past, (who came) before me, had marched through the difficult paths on account of the rugged mountains. I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Anara and Mount Uppa, mighty mountains, and I myself, in an armchair, with my combat troops, ascended with a struggle the steep mountain peaks.
He, Maniye, heard about the advance of my expeditionary force, and (then) he abandoned the city Ukku, his royal city, and fled afar. I entered his palace and carried off every kind of possession (and) property, (which were) without number, his substantial treasure. I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire his cities, and made (them) like ruin hill(s) (created by) the Deluge.
On my sixth campaign: Against the cities Nagītu (and) Nagītu-diʾbina, cities of the king of the land Elam whose dwellings are situated on the other shore of the Bitter Sea, (and) the people of Bīt-Yakīn, who became afraid of the mighty weapon(s) of the god Aššur and abandoned their settlements, crossed the Bitter Sea, and ... ... on the far shore.
The god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and I ordered the march against them, to the land Nagītu. I settled in Nineveh the people of the land Ḫatti plundered by my bow(s) and they skillfully built magnificent ships, a product characteristic of their land. I gave orders to sailors of the cities Tyre (and) Sidon, (and) the land Io n ia, whom I had captured. They (my troops) let (the sailors) sail down the Tigris River with them downstream to the city Opis.
Then, from the city Opis, they lifted them (the boats) up onto dry land and dragged them on rollers t o Sippar and guided them into the Araḫtu canal, (where) they let them sail downstream to the canal of Bīt-Dakkuri, which is in Chaldea. (65) ... I loaded onto boats my fierce ... s, who do not know fear, my crack bodyguard, and my valiant combat troops, who do not ..., and I gave them provisions. I loaded grain and straw for the steeds with them. My warriors sailed down the Euphrates River on the boats, (70) while I accompanied them on dry land, and (then) I made my way to the city Bāb-salimeti. When I lifted my head, ... ... from the bank of the Euphrates to the shore of the sea, a distance covered in two double hours of marching. ... ... ... I was not concerned. I pitched camp in that place. The high tide of the sea rose mightily, and (then) (75) entered my tent and completely surrounded my entire camp. For five days and nights, on account of the strong water, all of my soldiers had to sit curled up as though they were in cages.
The boats of my warriors reached the marshy area at the mouth of the river, where the Euphrates River debouches its water into the roiling sea. I took my stand on the shore of the Bitter Sea opposite them and had pure sacrifices performed for the god Ea, king of the apsû. I cast (them) into the sea with a gold boat, a gold fish, (and) a gold crab, and (then) I immediately had my boats cross over to the land of the city Nagītu.
At the shore of the roiling sea — which was unsuitable and very difficult for (ships) to dock, horses to climb, and men to set foot on — the inhabitants of Chaldea living in the cities Nagītu (and) Nagītu-diʾbina, the people of the lands Ḫilmu, Pillatu, and Ḫupapanu saw the boats of my warriors and they gathered together archers, wagons, horses, (and) mules, a force without number. Before their (my warriors’) arrival, while drawing up in battleline at the Ulāya River, a river with good shores, (and) holding my troops (landing place on) the high ground, they (the Chaldeans and Elamites) sharpened their weapons.
My warriors reached the quay of the harbor (and) like locusts they swarmed out of the boats onto the shore against them and defeated them. They conquered the cities Nagītu, Nagītu-diʾbina, Ḫilmu, Pillatu, and Ḫupapanu, cities of the king of the land Elam. They carried off their garrisons, the population of Chaldea, the gods of all of the land Bīt-Yakīn, together with their property, and the people of (the) Elamite (king), wagons, horses, mules, (and) donkeys.
They loaded (them) onto their boats and brought (them) to this side (of the sea), to the city Bāb-salimeti, before me. They destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire those cities. They poured out deathly silence over the wide land of Elam.
From the booty of those lands, I conscripted 30,500 archers (and) 20, 2 00 shield bearers and added (them) to my royal contingent. I divided up the rest of the substantial enemy booty like sheep and goats among my entire camp and my governors, (and) the people of my cult centers.
At that time, the palace in the citadel of Nineveh, whose extent was 360 cubits on (its) longer side (and) 95 cubits on (its) shorter side, and whose site was too small; (and) which earlier kings, my ancestors, had had constructed for their lordly dwelling, but whose construction they had carried out inexpertly:
They quarried bull colossi of white limestone in the city Tastiate to be their (the palatial halls’) gatekeepers. Throughout all of their lands they depleted forests of large trees to have boats built. In the month Ayyāru (II), the time of spring floods, they brought (the colossi) across to this side (of the river) with difficulty in magnificent boats. They sank large boats at the quay dock (and then) made their crews struggle (and) strain. With might and main, they struggled to transport (the colossi) and install (them) in their gates.
The Tebilti River, a tempestuous flood (of water) which had flowed from distant days by the side of the palace (and) had shaken its base when its flood was in full spate:
I tore down that small palace in its entirety. I diverted the course of the Tebilti River from the center of the city and directed its outflow into the meadow behind the city.
In a one-half ikû (stretch) of the water’s (natural) course, I bonded together with bitumen four large limestone (blocks) and spread marsh reeds and rushes over them. As an addition, I took a plot of land that was 554 cubits long (and) 289 cubits wide from the Ḫusur River and from the plain of the city (and) added (it) to the dimensions of the former terrace. In its (the terrace’s) entirety, I raised its superstructure 190 courses of brick high.
I enlarged the structure of the palace to 914 large cubits along (its) longer side and 440 large cubits along (its) shorter side and (thus) I made its site bigger.
I built a palace of gold, silver, bronze, ...-stone, breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, cypress, juniper, elammaku-wood, (and) Indian wood, for my lordly residence, and (then) I had a house with double doors, a replica of a Hittite palace, constructed opposite (its) gates.
I roofed them (the palatial halls) with beams of cedar (and) cypress, whose scent is sweet, product(s) of Mount Amanus and Mount Sirāra, the holy mountains. I fastened bands of silver (and) copper on doors of cedar, cypress, (and) juniper and I installed (them) in their gates.
In the corridors that are within the papāḫu-chambers, I made openings for latticed windows. At their gates, I stationed apotropaic figures of alabaster (and) elephant ivory, whose folded hands hold poppies, who are laden with pride (and) allure, (and) who are filled with exuberance, and (thus) I made (them) an object of wonder.
The covering of the roof that (hangs) over the corridors — I made their somber atmosphere cheerful, making (them) as bright as day. I decorated them with silver and copper knobbed nails. I adorned the arches, friezes, and all of its copings with baked bricks (glazed in the color of) obsidian (and) lapis lazuli.
So that the construction of my palace might be carried out correctly and that my handiwork be completed, at that time, the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar, who love my priestly service (and) who selected me (lit. “who called my name”), revealed to me a source of trunks of cedar, which since distant days grew tall and very thick as they stood in seclusion in the Sirāra mountain range.
In the uplands of Mount Ammanāna (northern Anti-Lebanon), they (Aššur and Ištar) disclosed to me the location of alabaster, which in the time of the kings, my ancestors, was too expensive (even) for the pommel of a sword.
Moreover, breccia, as much as is needed (for making) burzigallu-bowls, (a stone) that had never been seen before, revealed itself at Kapridargilâ (“Dargilâ Village”), which is on the border of the city Tīl-Barsip.
Near Nineveh, in the territory of the city Balāṭāya, by divine will, white limestone was discovered in abundance, and (then) I created bull colossi and (other) statues with limbs of alabaster that are sculpted from a single stone, (whose) proportions are perfect, (and) who stand high on their own pedestals; sphinxes of alabaster whose features are exquisite (and) whose bodies shine like a brilliant day; (and) magnificent slabs of breccia. I cut (them) free on both sides from their mountains, and (then), for the construction of my palace, I had (them) dragged into Nineveh.
I had large bull colossi and sphinxes of white limestone created in the territory of the city Balāṭāya and their forms perfected through the craft of the deity Ninkura.
Since time immemorial, the kings, my ancestors, created copper statues, replicas of their (own) forms, to be erected in temples, and through their manufacture they had exhausted all of the craftsmen. Through ignorance (and) failure to give thought on the matter, they depleted the oil, wax, (and) wool in their lands for the work they desired.
(But) as for me, Sennacherib, the foremost of all rulers, expert in every type of work, regarding large columns of copper (and) striding lion colossi, which none of the kings of the past (who came) before me had cast: With the ingenious mind that the prince, the god Ninšiku, had granted to me (and) taking counsel with myself, I intensively pondered how to perform this work. Then, with my (own) ideas and knowledge, I created a cast work of copper and expertly carried out its artful execution.
By divine will, I created clay mold(s) of tree trunks and date palm(s), the tree of abundance, (of) twelve raging lions, as well as (of) twelve magnificent bull colossi with perfect features (and) twenty-two sphinxes that are coated in allure and charm (and) that have pride (and) exuberance heaped upon them, and I poured copper into it. Just like the cast work of (an object weighing only) a half shekel, I perfected their form(s).
I made bull colossi with copper features, two of which were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, (and) bull colossi of alabaster, together with bull colossi and sphinxes of white limestone, hold the door bolts of my palatial halls.
I fastened bands of copper on magnificent copper columns, as well as on large cedar columns, which are the product of Mount Amanus, and (then) I installed (them) upon lion colossi and positioned cross-beams (upon them) as a cornice for their gates.
Sphinxes of alabaster, as well as sphinxes of cast urudû-copper that were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, and sphinxes of cast ...-metal, whose features were brilliant: I erected over them columns of ebony, cypress, cedar, daprānu-juniper, juniper, and Indian wood, with pašallu-gold and silver inlays, and (then) I positioned the architraves of the inner rooms of my lordly residence (on those columns).
I surrounded their (the palace rooms’) lower courses with slabs of breccia (and) alabaster, and large limestone slabs (and) made (them) an object of wonder.
In order to be able to draw water by bucket every day, I had bronze wire chains and bronze cables made and, instead of poles, I had tree trunks and date palm(s) placed over wells.
I made those palatial halls beautiful. To be an object of wonder for all of the people, I raised the superstructure of the entire palace. I called it the “Palace Without a Rival.”
I planted alongside it (the palace) a botanical garden, a replica of Mount Amanus, which has all kinds of aromatic plants (and) fruit trees, trees that are the mainstay of the mountains and Chaldea, collected inside it.
To make (those) planted areas luxuriant, I cut with iron picks a canal straight through a mountain, from the border of the city Kisiru to the plain of Nineveh. I caused an inexhaustible supply of water to flow there for a distance of one and a half leagues from the Ḫusur River (and) made (it) gush through feeder canals into those planted areas.
I created a marsh to moderate the flow of water for (those) gardens and planted a canebrake in it. I let loose in it herons, wild boars (lit. “pigs of the reeds”), (and) r oe deer. By divine will, vines, all kinds of fruit trees, olive trees, (and) aromatic trees flourished greatly in (those) gardens. Cypress trees, musukkannu-trees, (and) all kinds of trees grew tall and sent out shoots. The marshes thrived greatly. Birds of the heavens, heron(s), made nest(s) and wild boars (and) roe deer gave birth in abundance.
I cut down musukkannu-trees (and) cypress trees grown in the orchards (and) marsh reeds from the swamps and I used (them) in the work required (to build) my lordly palatial halls.
After I had finished the work on my palace, I invited inside it the god Aššur, the great lord, (and) the gods and goddesses living in Assyria, and (then) I made splendid offerings and presented my gift(s). I made fine oil from olives and aromatics. At the inauguration of the palace, I had the heads of the subjects of my land drenched (and) I watered their insides with sweet wine.
By the command of (the god) Aššur, father of the gods, and the goddess Ištar, the queen, may the good šēdu (and) the good lamassu last forever and ever in that palace. May they never leave it.
... ... ... In the uplands of Mount Ammanāna (northern Anti-Lebanon), they (Aššur and Ištar) disclosed to me the location of alabaster, which in the time of the kings, my ancestors, was too expensive (even) for the pommel of a sword.
Moreover, breccia, as much as is needed (for making) bur zigallu-bowls, (a stone) that had never been seen before, revealed itself at Kapridargilâ (“Dargilâ Village”).
Near Nineveh, in the territory of the city Balāṭāya, by divine will, white limestone was discovered in abundance, and (then) I created bull colossi of alabaster that are sculpted from a single stone, (whose) proportions are skillfully made; sphinxes of alabaster whose features are exquisite (and) whose bodies shine like a brilliant day; (and) magnificent slabs of breccia. ... ... ...
Palace of Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), favorite of the great gods, wise prince, circumspect ruler, shepherd of the people, (and) leader of a widespread population, I:
The goddess Bēlet-ilī, the lady of creation, looked steadfastly upon me and created my features (while I was still) in the womb of the mother who gave birth to me. Moreover, the god Ninšiku gave me wide understanding equal to (that of) the sage Adapa (and) endowed me with broad knowledge.
The god Aššur, father of the gods, made all of the black-headed (people) bow down at my feet (and) elevated me for shepherding the land and people. ... ... (and) he put in my hand a merciless weapon to fell enemies ....
... ... ... ... ... (and) which earlier kings, my ancestors, had had constructed for their lordly dwelling, but whose construction they had carried out inexpertly:
I tore down that small palace. I diverted the course of the Tebilti River from the center of the city and directed its outflow onto the meadow behind the city.
In a one-half ikû (stretch) of the water’s (natural) course, I bonded together with bitumen four large limestone (blocks) and spread marsh reeds and rushes over them. As an addition, I took a plot of land that was five hundred and ... cubits long (and) two hundred and eighty cubits wide from the plain of the city (and) I added (it) to the former dimensions of the palace. I enlarged (it) to 914 large cubits along (its) longer side and 460 large cubits along (its) shorter side (and thus) I made its site bigger. In its (the terrace’s) entirety, I raised its superstructure to a (total) height of 190 courses of brick.
In order to prevent its foundation from being weakened over the passage of time by cresting flood(s), I surrounded its base with large limestone (slabs and thereby) reinforced its base.
I built a palatial hall of gold, a palatial hall of silver, a palatial hall of bro nze, a palatial hall of ...-stone, a palatial hall of breccia, ..., a palatial hall of alallu-stone, a palatial hall of alabaster, a palatial hall of elephant ivory, a palatial hall of ebony, a palatial hall of boxwood, a palatial hall of musukkannu-wood, a palatial hall of cedar, a palatial hall of cypress, a palatial hall of juniper, a palatial hall of elammaku-wood, (and) a palatial hall of Indian wood, for my lordly residence, and (then) I had a house with double doors, a replica of a Hittite palace, constructed opposite (its) gates.
I roofed them (the palatial halls) with beams of cedar (and) cypress. I fastened bands of silver (and) copper on doors of white cedar (and) cypress and I installed (them) in their gates.
In the corridors, I made openings for latticed windows. At their gates, I stationed apotropaic figures of alabaster (and) elephant ivory, whose folded hands hold poppies, and (thus) I made (them) an object of wonder.
... I decorated them with silver and copper knobbed nails. I adorned the arches, friezes, and all of their copings with baked bricks (glazed in the color of) obsidian (and) lapis lazuli.
So that the construction of my palace ...
In the uplands of Mount Ammanāna (northern Anti-Lebanon), they (Aššur and Ištar) disclosed to me the location of alabaster, ... pendû-stone — whose appearance is as finely granulated as cucumber seeds, considered valuable enough to be an amulet, a stone for speaking (and) being accepted, as well as making storms pass by, (and) preventing illness from approaching a man — made itself known to me at the foot of Mount Nipur.
Breccia, whose appearance is like the wings of a dragonfly (and the qualities of which) calm headaches, a stone for happiness (and) cheerfulness, as much as is needed (for making) burzigallu-bowls, (a stone) that had never been seen before, revealed itself at Kapridargilâ (“Dargilâ Village”), which is on the border of the city Tīl-Barsip.
alallu-stone, whose appearance is like the bark of the date palm, and girimḫilibû-stone — whose appearance is like the fruit of the pomegranate tree, is beautiful (and) a pleasure to behold, (and) a stone for preventing plague from approaching a man — both stones were found in abundance at Mount ....

Palace of Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria: I had horse troughs of white limestone built so that fungus cannot carry (them) off (into death) in the future. I filled (the space) in front of these horse troughs under my warhorses’ feet with blocks of pappardilû-stone, papparmīnu-stone, (and) ḫulālu-stone, leftovers of my choice stones, as well as jasper, marble, breccia, pendû-stone, alallu-stone, girimḫilibû-stone, engisû-stone, alabaster, sābû-stone, ḫaltu-stone, (and) fragments of slabs (used in the building) of my palace.
I, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, gave this naḫbuṣu-vessel to Aššur-ilī-muballissu, my son. Whoever should take it away from him, from his sons, (or from) his grandsons, may (the god) Aššur, king of the gods, take away his life, as well as (those of) his sons, (and) may he (lit. “they”) make their name(s) (and) their seed, as well as (those of) his advisors, disappear from the land.
I, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, gave this kappu-vessel to Aššur-ilī-muballissu, my son.

Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), (...) son of Sargon (II), (...) great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, (king of the four quarters (of the world)):
On my first campaign, I brought about the defeat of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), (...) ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... you, my god, have seen my handiwork ... shrines in Akkad, earth, ... ...
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), capable shepherd, favorite of the great gods, guardian of truth who loves justice, renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (and) strives after good deeds, perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning:
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises. He made all of the black-headed (people) from the Upper Sea of the Setting Sun to the Lower Sea of the Rising Sun bow down at my feet. Thus did recalcitrant rulers come to fear battle with me.
... ... I rai sed as high as a mountain. ... In order to prevent its foundations from being weakened by rain (and ...), I had a supporting wall built (along) the circumference of the wall of the city ... (and) ... ....
I enlarged the site of the citadel and Nineveh, my capital city. I broadened their squares and brought light into the alleys and streets, making (them) as bright as day.
I had a bridge constructed opposite the Citadel Gate with paving stones of white limestone for the passage of my lordly chariot.
I fashioned an inscribed object and had all the mighty victories that I achieved (...) over all of (my) enemies and all of my (other) achievements inscribed thereon. With inscribed objects of earlier rulers, my ancestors, I deposited (it) for ever after in the citadel wall of Nineveh, my capital city, for the kings, my descendants.
At any time (in the future), may one of my descendants (lit. “future children”), whom (the god) Aššur names for the lordship of the land and people, renovate its dilapidated section(s) when that wall becomes old and dilapidated. May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Aššur and the goddess Ištar will (then) hear his prayers.
That which is upon the inscribed object that ...; belonging to Sennacherib ....
... they flew away alone ... to inaccessible place(s).
On my first campaign, I brought about the defeat of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), together with the troops of (the land) Elam, his allies, in the plain of Kish. In the midst of that battle he abandoned his camp, fled alone, and (thereby) saved his life. I seized the chariots, horses, wagons, (and) mules that he had abandoned in the thick of battle.
I defeated all together ..., Ubulu, Damunu, Gambulu, Ḫindaru, Ruʾuʾa, Puqudu, Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu, insubmissive Arameans. I carried off into Assyria a substantial booty (consisting of) 208,000 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, (and) sheep and goats.
In the course of my campaign, I received a substantial payment from Nabû-bēl-šumāti, the official in charge of the city Ḫararatu: gold, silver, large musukkannu-trees, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats.
I put to the sword the population of the city Ḫirimmu, a dangerous enemy, and I did not spare a single one. I hung their corpses on poles and placed (them) around the city. I reorganized that district (and) imposed for eternity one ox, ten sheep, ten homers of wine, (and) twenty homers of dates as his first-fruits offerings to the gods of Assyria, my lords.
On my second campaign, (the god) Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and I marched to the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians, who since time immemorial had not submitted to the kings, my ancestors. In the high mountains, difficult terrain, I rode on horseback and had my personal chariot carried on (men’s) necks. ...
I added (archers and shield bearers) to my royal contingent. I divided up the rest of the substantial enemy booty ... among my entire camp and my governors,
whose plan had been designed by the stars (lit. “writing”) of the firmament and whose arrangement was made manifest since time immemorial; a sophisticated place (and) site of secret lore in which every kind of skilled craftsmanship, all of the rituals, (and) the secret(s) of the lalgar (cosmic subterranean water) are apprehended;
I measured (the terrace’s) dimensions. In order to prevent its foundation from being weakened over the passage of time by cresting flood(s), I surrounded its base with large limestone slabs (and thereby) reinforced its base.
I inscribed objects bearing my name 160 courses of brick within the terrace and I deposited (them) deep down in its foundation for ever after.
Afterwards, I decided to increase the height of the terrace, and (then) I built up 20 courses of brick to the former (terrace) and (thus) I raised (it) to a (total) height of 1 80 courses of brick. I made the area larger than before, added (it) to the former dimensions of the palace, and (thus) enlarged its structure.
I had a palace of breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, cypress, juniper, and elammaku-wood, (a palace that I named) Egalzagdinutukua (the “Palace Without a Rival”), constructed thereon as my royal residence.
I planted alongside it (the palace) a botanical garden, a replica of Mount Amanus, which has all kinds of aromatic plants (and) fruit trees, trees that are the mainstay of the mountains and Chaldea, collected inside it.
To plant gardens, I subdivided the meadowland upstream of the city into plots of four pānu each for the citizens of Nineveh and I handed (them) over to them.
To make (those) planted areas luxuriant, I cut with iron picks a canal straight through mountain and valley, from the border of the city Kisiru to the plain of Nineveh. I caused an inexhaustible supply of water to flow there for a distance of one and a half leagues from the Ḫusur River (and) made (it) gush through feeder canals into those gardens.
By divine will, vines, all kinds of fruit trees, olive trees, and aromatic trees flourished greatly in (those) gardens. Cypress trees, musukkannu-trees, (and) all kinds of trees grew tall and sent out shoots. I created a marsh to moderate the flow of water for (those) gardens and had a canebrake planted (in it).
... ... ... he (Ispabāra) fled far away. I overwhelmed all of his wide land like a fog. I surrounded, conquered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Marʾubištu (and) Akkuddu, cities of his royal house, together with thirty-four small(er) settlements in their environs.
I carried off people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats without number, and (then) I brought him (Ispabāra) to nought and made his land smaller. ...
... ... ... ... ... In the high mountains, difficult terrain, I rode on horseback and had my personal chariot carried on (men’s) necks. In very rugged terrain I roamed about on foot like a wild bull. I surrounded (and) conquered the cities Bīt-Kilamzaḫ, Ḫardišpu, (and) Bīt-Kubatti, their fortified walled cities. I brought out from them people, horses, mules, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats, and I counted (them) as booty. Moreover, I destroyed, devastated, (and) turned into ruins their small(er) settlements, which were without number. I burned with fire pavilions (and) tents, their abodes, and reduced (them) to ashes.
I made that city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ a fortress again (and) I strengthened its walls more than before, and (then) I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I brought down from the mountains the people of the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians who had fled from my weapons and I made (them) dwell in the cities Ḫardišpu (and) Bīt-Kubatti. I placed them under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Arrapḫa. I had a stele made, had all the victorious conquests that I achieved over them written on it, and I erected (it) in (that) city.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Ellipi. Before my arrival, Ispabāra, their king, abandoned his fortified cities (and) his treasury and fled far away. I overwhelmed all of his wide land like a fog. I surrounded, conquered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Marʾubištu (and) Akkuddu, cities of his royal house, together with thirty-four small(er) settlements in their environs.
I carried off people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats without number, and (then) I brought him (Ispabāra) to nought and made his land smaller. I detached from his land the cities Ṣi(ṣ)ṣirtu (and) Kummaḫlum, fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements in their environs (and) the district of the land Bīt-Barrû in its entirety, and I added (this area) to the territory of Assyria.
I took the city Elenzaš as a royal city and a fortress for that district, and (then) I changed its former name and called it Kār-Sennacherib. I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I placed (it) under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Ḫarḫar, and (thus) enlarged my land.
On my return march, I received a substantial payment from the distant Medes, of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had heard mention. (Thus) I made them bow down to the yoke of my lordship.
On my third campaign, I marched to the land Ḫatti. Fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed Lulî, the king of the city Sidon, and he fled afar into the midst of the sea. The awesome terror of the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed the cities Great Sidon, Lesser Sidon, Bīt-Zitti, Ṣarepta, Maḫalliba, Ušû, Akzibu, (and) Acco, his fortified cities (and) fortresses, an area of pasture(s) and water-place(s), resources upon which he relied, and they bowed down at my feet.
I placed Tu-Baʾlu on his royal throne over them and imposed upon him tribute (and) payment (in recognition) of my overlordship (to be delivered) yearly (and) without interruption.
As for Minuḫimmu of the city Samsimuruna, Tu-Baʾlu of the city Sidon, Abdi-Liʾti of the city Arwad, Ūru-Milki of the city Byblos, Mitinti of the city Ashdod, Būdi-il of the city Bīt-Ammon, Kammūsu-nadbi of the land Moab, Aya-rāmu of the land Edom, all of the kings of the land Amurru, they brought extensive gifts, four times (the normal amount), as their substantial audience gift before me and kissed my feet.
Moreover, (as for) Ṣidqâ, the king of the city Ashkelon who had not bowed down to my yoke, I forcibly removed the gods of his father’s house, himself, his wife, his sons, his daughters, his brothers, (and other) offspring of his father’s house and took him to Assyria.
I set Šarru-lū-dāri, son of Rūkibtu, their former king, over the people of the city Ashkelon and imposed upon him the payment of tribute (and) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship so that he (now) pulls my yoke.
In the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Bīt-Daganna, Joppa, Banayabarqa, (and) Azuru, the cities of Ṣidqâ that had not submitted to me quickly.
(As for) the governors, the nobles, and the people of the city Ekron who had thrown Padî, their king who was bound by treaty and oaths to Assyria, into iron fetters and who had handed him over to Hezekiah of the land Judah in a hostile manner, they became frightened on account of the villainous acts they had committed. They formed a confederation with the kings of Egypt (and) the archers, chariots, (and) horses of the king of the land Meluḫḫa, forces without number, and they came to their aid.
In the plain of the city Eltekeh, they sharpened their weapons while drawing up in battleline before me. With the support of the god Aššur, my lord, I fought with them and defeated them. In the thick of battle, I captured alive the Egyptian charioteers (and) princes (lit. “the sons of the kings”), together with the charioteers of the king of the land Meluḫḫa.
I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Eltekeh (and) Tamnâ. I approached the city Ekron and I killed the governors (and) nobles who had committed crime(s) and hung their corpses on towers around the city; I counted the citizens who had committed the criminal acts as booty; (and) I commanded that the rest of them, (those) who were not guilty of crimes or wrongdoing, (to) whom no penalty was due, be allowed to go free.
I brought out Padî, their king, from the city Jerusalem and placed (him) on the lordly throne over them, and (then) I imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
(As for) Hezekiah of the land Judah, who had not submitted to my yoke, I surrounded (and) conquered forty-six of his fortified walled cities and small(er) settlements in their environs, which were without number, by having ramps trodden down and battering rams brought up, the assault of foot soldiers, sapping, breaching, and siege engines. I brought out of them 200,150 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number, and I counted (them) as booty.
As for him (Hezekiah), I confined him inside the city Jerusalem, his royal city, like a bird in a cage. I set up blockades against him and made him dread exiting his city gate. I detached from his land the cities of his that I had plundered and I gave (them) to Mitinti, the king of the city Ashdod, and Padî, the king of the city Ekron, (and) Ṣilli-Bēl, the king of the land Gaza, and (thereby) made his land smaller. To the former tribute, their annual giving, I added the payment (of) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship and imposed (it) upon them (text: “him”).
As for him, Hezekiah, fear of my lordly brilliance overwhelmed him and, after my (departure), he had the auxiliary forces and his elite troops whom he had brought inside to strengthen the city Jerusalem, his royal city, and who had provided support, along with 30 talents of gold, 800 talents of silver, choice antimony, large blocks of ..., ivory beds, armchairs of ivory, elephant hide(s), elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood, every kind of valuable treasure, as well as his daughters, his palace women, male singers, (and) female singers brought into Nineveh, my capital city, and he sent a mounted messenger of his to me to deliver (this) payment and to do obeisance.
On my fourth campaign, ... they entrusted him with ... ... ...
... I marched ... every kind of valuable treasure, ... ... and Akk ad ...
... to (the city) Nagīte-raqqi, which is in the midst of the sea. ... the land Bīt-Yakīn and within the swamps ...
... I poured out awe-inspiring brilliance upon his ally, the king of (the land) Elam. ... I confined them within the marshes ...
From the booty of those lands that I had plundered, I conscripted 10,000 archers (and) 10,000 shield bearers and added (them) to my royal contin gent. I divided up the rest of the substantial enemy booty like sheep and goats among my entire camp and my governors, (and) the people of my great cult centers.
... ... ...
Būdi-il of the land Bīt-Ammon, Kammūsu-nadbi of the land Moab, Aya-rāmu of the land Edom, all of the kings of the land Amurru, they brought extensive gifts, four times (the normal amount), as their substantial audience gift before me and kissed my feet.
Moreover, (as for) Ṣidqâ, the king of the city Ashkelon who had not bowed down to my yoke, I forcibly removed the gods of his father’s house, himself, his wife, his sons, his daughters, his brothers, (and other) offspring of his father’s house and took him to Assyria.
I set Šarru-lū-dāri, son of Rūkibtu, their former king, over the people of the city Ashkelon and imposed upon him the payment of tribute (and) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship so that he (now) pulls my yoke.
In the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Bīt-Daganna, Joppa, Banayabarqa, (and) Azuru, the cities of Ṣidqâ that had not submitted to me quickly.
(As for) the governors, the nobles, and the people of the city Ekron who had thrown Padî, their king who was bound by treaty and oaths to Assyria, into iron fetters and who had handed him over to Hezekiah of the land Judah in a hostile manner, they became frightened on account of the villainous acts they had committed.

I brought out Padî, their king, from the city Jerusalem and placed (him) on the lordly throne over them, and (then) I imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
(As for) Hezekiah of the land Judah, I surrounded (and) conquered forty-six of his fortified walled cities and small(er) settlements in their environs, which were without number, by having ramps trodden down and battering rams brought up, the assault of foot soldiers, sapping, breaching, and siege engines. I brought out of them 200,150 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number, and I counted (them) as booty.
I ruined the wide district of the land Judah (and) imposed my yoke on Hezekiah, its king.
I put to the sword the people of the city Tumurrum, who live on a rugged mountain (Mount Nipur). I destroyed the city Ukku, together with every one of its settlements, (so that they looked) like a ruin hill (created by) the Deluge.
I struck down with the sword the people of the land Ḫilakku, who live in the high mountains.
I conquered and plundered the city Tīl-Garimme, which is on the border of the land Tabal.
The cities Nagītu (and) Nagītu-diʾbina, the lands Ḫilmu, Pillatu, (and) Ḫupapanu, districts (of the king of the land Elam) that are situated on the other shore of the sea, in which the people of the land Bīt-Yakīn — having, because of my mighty weapons, dislodged the gods of the (full) extent of their land from their abodes (and) crossed the sea — took up residence inside: (i 10´) I crossed the sea in boats of the land Ḫatti, which I had built in Nineveh and the city Tīl-Barsip. I conquered and burned with fire the cities in those districts, (and) I turned (them) into a mound of ruins (lit. “a mound and ruins”). I carried off the people of the land Bīt-Yakīn and their gods, together with soldiers of the king of the land Elam, and I brought (them) to Assyria.

Through divination, at the command of the gods Šamaš and Adad, I built the akītu-house of the steppe for the qerītu-festival, which had been forgotten for a long time. I named it Eabb a ugga, “House (where) Tiāmat Is Put to Death.” I named its cella Edubdubabba, “House that Makes the Host of Tiāmat Trem ble. ”
Through the craft of the deity Ninagal and my own expertise, I had a gate of reddish bronze made that is entirely (one single) metal b and. According to the command that the gods Šamaš and Adad gave me through divination, I depicted on this gate an image of (the god) Aššur, who is going to fight Tiāmat, (showing) the bow as he carries (it), in the chariot which he rides, (and) the Deluge which he has harnessed, (and) the god Amurru as the driver who rides with him.
According to the command of the gods Šamaš and Adad, I depicted on this gate (a scene showing) the gods, as many as go in front of him and go behind him, those who ride in vehicles (and) those who go on foot; their positions as they are arrayed before (the god) Aššur and arrayed behind (the god) Aššur; (and) Tiāmat, < with> the creatures (created) inside her, against whom (the god) Aššur, king of the gods, goes to fight.
According to the command of the gods Šamaš and Adad, ditto (= I depicted on this gate a scene showing) the rest of the gods who go on foot. According to the command of the gods Šamaš and Adad, I did not depict (the scene) before Aššur captures Tiāmat, carries off the beasts of Tiāmat, gives ... his ... s as they run about on foot like this one, ... who are not depicted with them. I put in writing (the details of the scene) on this gate and splendidly erected (it) ... in silver, gold, (and) bronze.
To break down utensils of silver, gold, (and) reddish bronze, to melt down (metal) from 1,000 talents to one shekel, (and) to smelt (them) together: (20) I myself, the one who understands their technique (and) who grasps their casting, have mastered (these skills). If you do not believe (the record of) the casting of this bronze, I (hereby) swear by the king of the gods, (the god) Aššur, the god who created me, where this inscription is written down and where the image of (the god) Aššur and the image of the gods, as many as go to fight against Tiāmat with him, are depicted, that I myself had this metal-work cast. So that it will be known to future generations: (25) I increased therein the amount of tin. Know through this that I myself had this metal-work cast.

At that time, the private room ... of the palace of Baltil (Aššur), the seat of the kings, my ancestors, from distant days, of Tiglath-pileser (I), son of Aššur-rēša-iši (I), king of Assyria, became dilapidated. Ashurnasirpal (II), king of Assyria, son of Tukultī-Ninurta (II), king of Assyria, renovated its dilapidated section(s). That private room ... (and) its construction was inexpert (and thus) I tore down that cella.
I had a large private room constructed anew to be my lordly seat (and) through the craft of well-trained master builders I built (and) completed (it) from its foundations to its battlements. I roofed it with magnificent beams of cedar grown on Mount Amanus. I fastened (metal bands) on facing doors of white cedar and I installed (them) in its gate.
I invited inside it (the god) Aššur, the great lord, (and) the gods and god desses living in Baltil (Aššur), (and then) I made splendid offerings before them (of) enormous wild bul ls (and) fattened sheep.

With the strength of the god Aššur, my lord, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered 75 of his fortified cities, fortresses of Chaldea, and 420 small(er) settlements in their environs. I brought out the auxiliary forces of the Arameans (and) Chaldeans who were in Uruk, Nippur, Kish, Ḫursagkalama, Cutha, (and) Sippar, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.
On my return march, I defeated all together the Tuʾumuna, Riḫiḫu, Yadaqqu, Ubudu, Gibrê, Malaḫu, Gurumu, Ubulu, Damunu, Gambulu, Ḫindaru, Ruʾuʾa, Puqudu, Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu, insubmissive Arameans. ... ...
I marched to the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians, who since time immemorial had not submitted to the kings, my ancestors. In the high mountains, difficult terrain, I rode on horseback and had my personal chariot carried on (men’s) necks. In very rugged terrain I roamed about on foot like a wild bull.
I surrounded (and) conquered the cities Bīt-Kilamzaḫ, Ḫardišpu, (and) Bīt-Kubatti, their fortified walled cities. I brought out of them people, horses, mules, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats, and I counted (them) as booty. Moreover, I destroyed, devastated, (and) turned into ruins their small(er) settlements, which were without number. I burned with fire pavilion(s) (and) tents, their abodes, and reduced (them) to ashes.
I made that city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ a fortress again (and) I strengthened its walls more than before, and (then) I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. I brought down from the mountains the people of the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians who had fled from my weapons and I made (them) dwell in the cities Ḫardišpu (and) Bīt-Kubatti. I placed them under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Arrapḫa. I had a stele made, had all the victorious conquests that I achieved over them written on it, and I erected (it) in (that) city.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Ellipi. Before my arrival, Ispabāra, their king, abandoned his fortified cities (and) his treasury and fled far away. I overwhelmed all of his wide land like a fog. I surrounded, conquered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Marʾubištu (and) Akkuddu, cities of his royal house, together with thirty-four small(er) settlements in their environs.
I carried off people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats without number, and (then) I brought him (Ispabāra) to nought and made his land smaller. I detached from his land the cities Ṣi(ṣ)ṣirtu (and) Kummaḫlum, fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements in their environs (and) the district of the land Bīt-Barrû in its entirety, and I added (this area) to the territory of Assyria.
I took the city Elenzaš as a royal city and a fortress for that district, and (then) I changed its former name and
... Kammūsu-nadbi of the land Moab, Aya-rāmu of the land Edom, all of the kings of the land Amurru, they brought extensive gifts, four times (the normal amount), as their substantial audience gift before me and kissed my feet.
Moreover, (as for) Ṣidqâ, the king of the city Ashkelon who had not submitted to my yoke, I forcibly removed the gods of his father’s house, himself, his wife, his sons, his daughters, his brothers, (and other) offspring of his father’s house and took him to Assyria.
I set Šarru-lū-dāri, son of Rūkibtu, their former king, over the people of the city Ashkelon and imposed upon him the payment of tribute (and) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship so that he (now) pulls my yoke.
In the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Bīt-Daganna, Joppa, Banayabarqa, (and) Azuru, the cities of Ṣidqâ that had not submitted to me quickly.
(As for) the governors, the nobles, and the people of the city Ekron who had thrown Padî, their king who was bound by treaty and oaths to Assyria, into iron fetters and who had handed him over to Hezekiah of the land Judah in a hostile manner, they became frightened on account of the villainous acts they had committed. They formed a confederation with the kings of Egypt (and) the archers, chariots, (and) horses of the king of the land Meluḫḫa, forces without number, and they came to their aid.
In the plain of the city Eltekeh, they sharpened their weapons while drawing up in battleline before me. With the support of the god Aššur, my lord, I fought with them and ... I captured ... ....
I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Eltekeh (and) Tamnâ. I approached the city Ekron and I killed the governors (and) nobles who had committed crime(s) and hung their corpses on towers around the city; ...
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), leader of a widespread population, the one who fashioned image(s) of the deities Aššur, Anu, Sîn, Šamaš, Adad, Nergal, Ištar of Bīt-Kidmuru, Bēlet-ilī, and the (other) great gods, the one who carries out to perfection the rites of Ešarra and Emašmaš, who knows well how to revere the gods of heaven and the gods of Assyria, the builder of Assyria, the one who brings his cult centers to completion, the one who uproots enemies (and) destroys their settlements, circumspect ruler whose dominion is more praised than (that of all) kings who sit on (royal) daises, the support of his land, the one who is trustworthy in battle and combat, (and) the protection of his troops, I:
At that time, with regard to Eḫursaggalkurkurra, which is within Ešarra, the sanctuary of (the god) Aššur — the great lord, my lord — (and) whose proper orientation fell by the wayside in distant days: Its gate opened toward the south. With the extensive wisdom that the god Ea had given me, with the perspicacity that (the god) Aššur had granted to me, I took counsel with myself and made up my mind to open the gate of Eḫursaggalkurkurra towards the rising sun, facing east.
I found out the will of the gods Šamaš (and) Adad and they answered me with a firm ‘yes,’ and (then) the gods Šamaš and Adad commanded that that gate be opened towards the rising sun, facing east. At that time, I made several breaches in the wall, and (then) I opened a new gate towards (the god) Aššur, my lord, towards the east, and named it “The Royal Gate.”
I built anew the bīt-šuḫūru and widened its gate. At that gate of the bīt-šuḫūru, four bull-shaped son-of-Šamaš figures of reddish bronze raise up in their hands a sun disk (and) hold up the roof above, (while) below, their feet are firmly planted in place on two bronze daises, (one) of a bronze fish man (and one) of a bronze carp man. On the right and left of the gate, a lion-man figure and a scorpion-man figure hold the door bolt(s). I named that (lit. “those”) gate “The Gate of the Path of the Enlil-Stars.”
I built anew its courtyard and named it “The Courtyard of the Row of Pedestals for the Igīgū gods.” I gave the gate that faces the rising sun, towards the river, the name “The Gate of the Firmament.” I gave its entrance gate to the courtyard the name “The Entrance of the Igīgū gods.” I gave the gate that faces south the name “The Kamsū-Igīgū Gate.” I gave its entrance gate to the courtyard the name “The Gate of the Abundance of the Land.” I gave its gate that faces north the name “The Gate of the Wagon Star.” I gave its entrance gate to the courtyard the name “The Gate of the Dais of Destinies.”
I completed the gate of the cella, the bīt-šaḫūru, its walls, together with its courtyard, (its) rooms, (and) (its) gates, from its foundations to its crenellations with the craft of the god Kulla and I raised its superstructure (as high) as a mountain. With my innate expertise, I named the gates and their courtyard and I gave (them) their names.
O foundation inscription, speak favorable things to (the god) Aššur about Sennacherib, king of Assyria, the one who loves correct behavior, the one who fashioned the image of his god, (and) the one who built (this) temple, so that his offspring, his sons, (and) his grandsons may flourish together with Baltil (Aššur) and Ešarra (and) endure forever with the black-headed (people).
May any future ruler whom (the god) Aššur names for shepherding the land and people (and) during whose reign that temple becomes dilapidated renovate its dilapidated section(s). May he find my inscribed objects, anoint (them) with oil, make an offering, (and) put (them) back in their (text: “its”) place. (The god) Aššur will (then) hear his prayers.
(As for) the one who alters my inscribed object (and) disrespects my words, may (the god) Aššur, king of the gods, and the great gods of heaven and netherworld curse him with a harsh curse, and may they overthrow his kingship, deprive him of his life, (and) make his name, his seed, his offspring, (and) his progeny disappear from the mouth of the people.

Then, after I had made the image of (the god) Aššur, the great lord, my lord, and the image(s) of the great gods, and installed them in their peaceful dwellings, in the month Nisannu (I), the first month, (the month) of father Enlil, the month of the heliacal rising of the Plow-star: (15) The festival of the feast of the king of the gods, (the god) Aššur, which from distant days, because of chaos and disruption, (and) the a kītu-house of the steppe had been forgotten; the rites of the king of the gods, (the god) Aššur, had been performed inside the city. With (regard to) that work, I made up my mind to (re)build that a kītu-house, and (then) I found out the will of the gods Šamaš (and) Adad, and they answered me with a firm ‘yes’ and commanded me to (re)build (it).
In a favorable month, on a propitious day, through the craft of the purification priest
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), leader of a widespread population, the one who fashioned image(s) of (the god) Aššur and the great gods, the one who carries out to perfection the forgotten rites of Ešarra through divination, at the command of (5) the gods Šamaš and Adad, the one who makes great their purification rites, the one who returns the abandoned protective spirit of Ešarra to its place, who knows well how to revere the gods of heaven and the gods of Assyria, who exalts the great gods in their dwellings, who makes their accoutrements great,
the builder of Assyria, the one who brings his cult centers to completion, the one who makes enemy land(s) obedient, the one who destroys their settlements, the one who has canals dug, the one who opens streams, the one who makes watercourses gush, the one who establishes abundance and plenty in the wide plains of Assyria, the one who provides irrigation water in the meadows of Assyria — (15) which from the days of yore no one in Assyria had seen or known canals and artificial irrigation and which none in bygone times had used —
the one who makes brickwork structures (lit. “the craft of the god Kulla”) secure, from buildings for the living to tombs befitting the dead (made) from limestone, stone from the mountains, with which none of (20) the kings of the past (who came) before me in Assyria had used, circumspect ruler whose dominion is more praised than (that of all) kings who sit on (royal) daises, the support of his land, the one who is trustworthy in battle and combat, (and) the protection of his troops, I:
Then, after I had made the image of (the god) Aššur, the great lord, my lord, and the image(s) of the great gods, and installed them in their peaceful dwellings, in the month Nisannu (I), the first month, (the month) of father Enlil, the month of the heliacal rising of (25) the Plow-star: The festival of the feast of the king of the gods, (the god) Aššur, which from distant days, because of chaos and disruption, (and) the akītu-house of the steppe had been forgotten; the rites of the king of the gods, (the god) Aššur, had been performed inside the city. With (regard to) that work, I made up my mind to (re)build th(at) akītu-house, and (then) I found out the will of the gods Šamaš (and) Adad, and they answered me with a firm ‘yes’ and commanded me to (re)build (it).
In a favorable month, on a propitious day, through the craft of the purification priest (and) the wisdom of the exorcist, I laid its foundation with limestone, stone from the mountains, and I raised its superstructure. I completed it from its foundations to its crenellations with stone from the mountains and raised it as high as a mountain. I had two canals dug around each of its sides, and (then) (35) I had it surrounded with a lush garden, an orchard with fruit, and placed a splendid plantation around it.
After I destroyed Babylon, smashed its gods, (and) put its people to the sword, I removed its earth in order to make the site of that city unrecognizable and I had (it) carried to the sea by the Euphrates River. (When) its dirt (40) reached Dilmun and the people of Dilmun saw (it), fear (and) terror of (the god) Aššur fell upon them and they brought their audience gift(s) to me. Together with their audience gift(s), they sent people mustered from their land, corvée workers, (with) bronze spades (and) bronze plowshares, tools manufactured in their land, in order to demolish Babylon.
In order to pacify (the god) Aššur, my lord, for people to sing the praises of his might, (and) for the admiration of future people, I removed dirt from Babylon and piled (it) up in heaps (and) mounds in that akītu-house.
While laying the foundation of the akītu-house, the audience gift of Karib-il, king of the land Saba — pappardilû-stone, choice stones, (and) fine aromatics — was presented to me (50) and from that audience gift I laid stones (and) aromatics in its foundation. Like ..., I ... silver, gold, carnelian, lapis lazuli, ḫulālu-stone, muššaru-stone, pappardilû-stone, papparmīnu-stone, dāmātu-paste, (and) all of the finest aromatics in the foundation of that akītu-house. I sprinkled that foundation with perfumed oil (and) fine oil as (abundantly as) river water.
O you, foundation inscription, speak favorable things to (the god) Aššur about Sennacherib, king of Assyria, the one who loves correct behavior, the one who fashioned the image of (the god) Aššur, (and) the one who built (this) temple, so that his offspring, his sons, (and) his grandsons may flourish together with Baltil (Aššur) and Ešarra (and) endure forever with the black-headed (people).

I am Sennacherib, king of Assyria, the ruler who reveres you.
Whoever erases (my) inscribed name (or) alters this Seal of Destinies belonging to you, erase his name (and) his seed from the land.
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of Assyria, unrivalled king, true shepherd, favorite of the great gods, guardian of truth who loves justice, renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (and) strives after good deeds, perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning:
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises.
At the beginning of my kingship, after I sat on the lordly throne (and) set to governing the people of Assyria in obedience and peace, Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), an evil foe, a rebel (with) a treacherous mind, an evildoer whose villainous acts are true, sought friendship with Šutur-Naḫundu (Šutur-Naḫḫunte II), an Elamite, by presenting him with gold, silver, (and) precious stones; then, he continuously requested reinforcements from him.
To the land of Sumer and Akkad, he (Šutur-Naḫundu) sent to his (Marduk-apla-iddina’s) assistance Imbappa, his field marshal, together with the massed body of his troops, Tannānu, (his) third man, ten unit commanders, including Nergal-nāṣir, a Sutian who marches before them, 80,000 archers (and) lancers, 850 wagons, (and) the 12,200 horses that were with them.
Moreover, he, the evil Chaldean, evildoer, (and) offspring of murder, gathered together Uruk, Larsa, Ur, Eridu, Kullaba, Kissik, (and) Nēmed-Laguda, the lands of the Bīt-Yakīn, Bīt-Amukāni, Bīt-Ašillāni (Bīt-Šillāni), Bīt-Saʾalli, (and) Bīt-Dakkūri, all of the Chaldeans, as many as there were; on the bank(s) of the Tigris River, the Tuʾumuna, Riḫiḫu, Yadaqqu, Gibrê, (and) Maliḫu (Malaḫu); on the bank(s) of the Surappu River, the Gurumu, Ubulu, Damunu, Gambulu, Hindaru, Ruʾuʾa, (and) Puqudu; on the bank(s) of the Euphrates River, the Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu — Arameans who did not know (fear of) death; (15) Nippur, Dilbat, Marad, Kish, Ḫursagkalama, Babylon, Borsippa, (and) Cutha, all of Karduniaš (Babylonia) and prepared (them) for battle.
When they reported his (Marduk-apla-iddina's) evil deeds to me, Sennacherib, the attentive man of the steppe, I raged up like a lion and ordered the march into Babylon to confront him. He (Marduk-apla-iddina), the (very) image of an evil gallû-demon, heard about the advance of my expeditionary force, and (then) he reinforced their companies with horses (and) Elamite, Aramean, (and) Chaldean archers, together with Nergal-nāṣir and ten unit commanders of the king of the land Elam who did not know (fear of) death, (and) the countless forces who were with them. He brought their contingents together in Cutha and had (them) keep watch at outposts for the approach of my expeditionary force.
I put my yoked teams in order. On the twentieth day of the month Šabāṭu (XI), like a powerful wild ox, I took the lead of my troops from Baltil (Aššur), but I did not wait for the main force of my army, nor did I wait for the rear guard. (20) I sent (my) chief eunuch (and) my provincial governors to Kish ahead of me, (saying): “Find out news of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), and do not be careless about putting a strong watch on him!”
He (Marduk-apla-iddina) saw my provincial governors, and (then) came out of the Zababa Gate with all of his troops and did battle with my magnates in the plain of Kish. The enemy prevailed over my magnates in the thick of battle and they (my magnates) were afraid to clash with his ... They sent their messenger to me in the plain of Cutha for help.
In my rage, I unleashed a fierce assault on Cutha, and (then) I slaughtered the warriors surrounding its wall like sheep and took possession of the city. I brought out horses, the Elamite, Aramean, (and) Chaldean archers, the Elamite unit commanders, and Nergal-nāṣir, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted them (as) booty.
I raged up like a lion and became furious like the Deluge. With my merciless warriors, I set out for Kish against Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan). Moreover, he, (that) evildoer, saw the disturbance from afar and fear fell upon him. He abandoned all of his troops and fled to the land Guzummānu.
I defeated Tannānu, together with the Elamite, Chaldean, and Aramean troops who had stood by him and had come to his aid, and I scattered his forces. I captured alive Adinu, a nephew of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), together with Basqānu, a brother of Iatiʾe, queen of the Arabs, along with their troops. I seized the chariots, wagons, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, (and) Bactrian camels that he had abandoned during the battle.
With a rejoicing heart and a radiant face, I rushed to Babylon and entered the palace of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan) to plunder the possessions and property therein. I opened his treasury and brought out gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, precious stones, beds, armchairs, a processional carriage, royal paraphernalia of his with gold (and) silver mountings, all kinds of possessions (and) property, a substantial treasure, (together with) his wife, his palace women, female stewards, eunuchs, courtiers, attendants, male singers, female singers, palace servant(s) who cheered up his princely mind, all of the craftsmen, as many as there were, (and) his palace attendants, and I counted (them) as booty.
I pursued him to the land Guzummānu and sent (my) warriors into the midst of swamps and marshes. For five days they sought him out, but his (hiding) place could not be found. I gathered all together the rest of his horses and troops, who were weary, (and) who had fled like deer instead of going with him, from the midst of the open country and plain.
In the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Amatu, Ḫauae, Supapu, Bīt-Sannabi, Qudayyin, Kidrina, Dūr-Ladini, Bitāti, Bānītu, Guzummānu, Dūr-Yanṣuri, Dūr-Abī-Yataʾ, Dūr-Rudumme, Bīt-Raḫê, Ḫapiša, Sadian, Ḫurudu, Ṣaḫrina, Iltuk, Allallu, Sabḫānu, Kār-Nergal, Apak, Bīt-Dannāya, Bīt-Abdāya, Baḫir, Marirâ, Marad, Yaqimuna, Kupruna, Bīt-Kudurri, Sūqa-Marusi, altogether 34 fortified walled cities of the land of the Bīt-Dakkūri, together with 250 small(er) settlements in their environs;
the cities Dūr-Appê, Dūr-Tanê, Dūr-Samaʾ, Sarrabātu, Ṣalaḫatu, Dūr-Abdāya, Sappi-ḫimari, Ṣibtu-ša-Makkamê, altogether 8 fortified walled cities of the land of the Bīt-Saʾalli, together with 120 small(er) settlements in their environs;
the cities Sapīya (Šapīya), Sarrabānu, Larak, Parak-Marri, Bīt-Ilu-bāni, Aḫudu, Ša-iṣṣur-Adad, Šaḫarratu, Manaḫḫu, Ša-amēlê, Dūr-Aqqīya, Nagītu, Nūr-abīnu, Ḫar-Ṣuarra, Dūr-Rukbi, Danda-Ḫulla, Dūr-Bir-Dada, Bīt-Reʾê, Dūr-Ugurri, Gindaina, Dūr-Uayyit, Bīt-Taurâ, Sapḫuna, Bu-ḫarru, (45) Ḫarbat-Iddina, Ḫarbat-Kalbi, Ša-barê, Bīt-Bāni-ilūya, Sulādu, Bīt-Iltama-samaʾa, Bīt-Dīni-ili, Daqala, Ḫameza, Bēlā, Tairu, Kiprānu, Iltaratu, Aqqar-ša-kīna, Sagabatu-ša-Mardukīya, altogether 39 fortified walled cities of the land of the Bīt-Amukāni, together with 350 small(er) settlements in their environs;
(and) the cities Bīt-Zabidīya, Larsa, Kullaba, Eridu, Kissik, Nēmed-Laguda, (and) Dūr-Yakīn, including the city Kār-Nabû, which is on the shore of the Bitter Sea, altogether 8 fortified walled cities of the land of the Bīt-Yakīn, together with 100 small(er) settlements in their environs;
the (grand) total is 88 fortified walled cities of Chaldea, together with 820 small(er) settlements in their environs.
I let (my) troops eat the grain (and) dates in their gardens (and) their crops in the countryside. I destroyed (them), devastated (them), burned (them) with fire, (and) I turned (them) into forgotten ruin hills.
I brought out the auxiliary forces of the Arameans (and) Chaldeans who were in Uruk, Nippur, Kish, (and) Ḫursagkalama, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.
I let (my) army eat the grain (and) dates in their gardens, the fields they had labored in, (and) the crops in the countryside, which is their life’s necessity.
I appointed over them Bēl-ibni, a son of a rab banî (and) a scion of Šuanna (Babylon), who had grown up like a young puppy in my palace, as king of the land of Sumer and Akkad.
On my return march, I defeated all together the Tuʾumuna, Riḫiḫu, Ubudu, Gibrê, Maliḫu (Malaḫu), Gurumu, Ubulu, Damunu, Gambulu, Ḫindaru, Ruʾuʾa, Puqudu, Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu, insubmissive Arameans, and I plundered them.
In the course of my campaign, I received a substantial payment from Nabû-bēl-šumāti, the official in charge of the city Ḫararatu: gold, silver, large musukkannu-trees, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats.
I < put> to the sword the population of the city Ḫirimmu, a dangerous enemy who since time immemorial had not submitted to the kings, my ancestors, and I did not leave one alive. I reorganized that district (and) imposed for eternity one ox, ten sheep, ten homers of wine, (and) twenty homers of dates as his first-fruits offerings for the ginû-offerings to the gods of Assyria, my lords.
I carried off into Assyria a substantial booty (consisting of) 208,000 people, male and female, 7,200 horses (and) mules, 11,073 donkeys, 5,230 camels, 80,100 oxen, (and) 800,100 sheep and goats. This is apart from the people, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats that all of my troops had carried away and appropriated for themselves.
Moreover, I struck with the sword the soldiers of the enemy, a recalcitrant force who had not submitted quickly to my yoke, and hung (their corpses) on poles.
At that time, Egallammes, the temple of the god Nergal that is inside the city Tarbiṣu, which Shalmaneser (III), a former ruler, son of Ashurnasirpal (II), (and grand)son of Tukultī-Ninurta (II), had built, became dilapidated. I tore down that temple in its entirety (and) reached its foundation pit. I filled in a terrace in an area (measuring) 200 cubits along (its) longer side (and) 100 cubits along (its) shorter side, (thus) adding to the size of the former temple. I made Egallammes larger than before. I built (and) completed (it) from its foundations to its battlements through the craft of clever master builders. For the god Nergal, who (lives) in the city Tarbiṣu, my lord, I indeed did a splendid job, which surpassed previous (work) and was worthy of (high) praise.
I brought the god Nergal, the lord of exalted strength, almighty (and) perfect, the foremost (warrior who has) no rival, inside it and I graciously settled (him) in his august dwelling. I made splendid (and) pure offerings (of) plump bulls (and) fattened sheep before him, and I held festivities inside that temple. I had the victorious conquests that I achieved over all of (my) enemies with his great support written on (my) inscribed object(s) and I deposited (them) for posterity, for the kings, my descendants.
In the future, may a future ruler, when this temple becomes old and dilapidated, find my inscribed objects, anoint (them) with oil, make an offering, (and) securely place (them) with inscribed object(s) bearing his name. The god Nergal will (then) hear his prayers.
The line count of the inscription is 69 (lines).
For the god Nergal, his lord: I, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, built Egallammes, which is in the city Tarbiṣu, from its foundations to its crenellations for my life, the well-being of my offspring, the overthrow of my enemies, the success of the harvest of Assyria, (and) the well-being of Assyria. I deposited (my) clay cones (therein).
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, had Egallammes, the temple of the god Nergal, which is in the city Tarbiṣu, built and I made (it) as bright as day.
For the god Nergal, his lord: Sennacherib, king of Assyria, built (and) completed Egallammes, which is in the city Tarbiṣu, from its foundations to its crenellations.
Sennacherib, great king, king of the world, king of Assyria, had the (inner) wall (and) the outer wall of the city Kilīzu built anew and raised as high as mountains.
Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria, had the outer wall of the city Kilīzu built with baked bricks.
The deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Adad, Ninurta, and Ištar, the great gods who stand at the side of the king, their favorite, and make his weapons prevail over all enemies:
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, the attentive prince (who is) your protégé, who by your firm ‘yes’ marched about and who made the insubmissive lands (and) disobedient people of the mountains bow down at his feet:
At that time, the cities Tumurrum, Šarum, Ḫalbuda, Kibšu, Ezāma, Qūa, (and) Qana, which were on the border of the land Katmuḫu, which were situated like the nests of eagle(s) on the peaks of Mount Nipur, (and) which since time immemorial (20) were an obstinate force that did not known how to respect (any) authority during (the reigns of) the kings, my ancestors — during the reign of my lordship, their gods abandoned them and made them vulnerable.
(No translation possible)
I marched against them. I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Nipur and ... my crack combat troops. Mount Nipur to ... ... I surrounded. I ... ... the gorges, the outflows of the mountains. ... upon the high peaks, ... ... the stars of the heavens ... to ... ... in a chair ... ... ... their summits ....
Like a (fierce) wild bull, I took the lead of them (the soldiers in my camp). Where it was too difficult for (my) chair, I leapt forward on my (own) two feet like a mountain goat. Where my knees became extremely tired, I sat down upon the mountain rock and drank cold water from a water skin to (quench) my thirst.
... I surrounded, conquered, (and) devastated those ... Their escapees (...) upon the peaks of Mount Nipur .... I pursued their ... on the peaks of the mountains.
Then, ... I had a stele made and had written (on it) the mighty victories of (the god) Aššur, my lord. I erected (it) for ever after on the peak of Mount Nipur, where ....
(As) for the one who alters my inscription, may (the god) Aššur (and) the great gods glare at him angrily (and) overthrow him.
Deities Aššur, Anu, Enlil, Ea, Sîn, Šamaš, Adad, Marduk, Nabû, Nergal, Ištar, (and) the Sebetti, the great gods, who install the lord (and) name the ruler to lead the black-headed (people) all over the inhabited world:
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), the prince who provides for them, by your firm ‘yes’ I marched about safely from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea, and (then) I made rulers of the (four) quarters (of the world) bow down at my feet and they (now) pull my yoke:
At that time, I greatly enlarged the site of Nineveh. I had its (inner) wall and its outer wall, which had never been constructed before, built anew and I raised (them) as high as mountain(s). Its fields, which had been turned into wastelands due to lack of water, were woven over with spider webs. Moreover, its people did not know artificial irrigation, but had their eyes turned for rain (and) showers from the sky.
I climbed high and I had eighteen canals dug from the cities Masitu, Banbarina, Šapparišu, Kār-Šamaš-nāṣir, Kār-nūri, Talmusu, Ḫatâ, Dalāyin, Rēš-ēni, Sulu, Dūr-Ištar, Šibaniba, Isparirra, Gingiliniš, Nampagātu, Tīlu, Alum-ṣusi, (and) the water that is above the city Ḫadabitu and I directed their courses into the Ḫusur River.
I had a canal dug from the border of the city Kisiru to Nineveh (and) I caused those waters to flow inside it. I named it Patti-Sennacherib. I directed the mass of those waters from Mount Tas, a rugged mountain near the land Urarṭu, to my land. Previously, that canal was called the ... canal.
Now, I, by the command of the god Aššur, the great lord, my lord, added to it the waters on the right and left of the mountain, which are beside it, and the waters of the cities Mēsu, Kukkinu, (and) Piturra, cities in its environs.
I dug that canal with (only) seventy men and I named it Nār-Sennacherib. I added (its water) to the water from the wells and the canals that I had previously dug, and (then) I directed their courses to Nineveh, the exalted cult center, my royal residence, whose site the kings, my ancestors, since time immemorial had not made large (enough), nor had they expertly carried out its artful execution.
Now I, Sennacherib — king of Assyria, foremost of all rulers, who marched about freely from east to west — thanks to the waters of the canals that I caused to be dug, I could plant around Nineveh gardens, vines, every type of fruit, ... ..., products of every mountain, fruit trees from all over the world, (including) spi ces and olive trees. Where water could not reach, I left waterless and ... a game preserve called ... all of the orchards, for entering the fields, above the city (and) below (the city), < from> the city Tarbiṣu to the city of the people of the Inner City (Aššur), I provided irrigation annually for the cultivation of grain and sesame.
(To) a later ruler, one of the kings, my descendants, who deliberates (the matter) in (his) heart but is not able to believe (it), (and) s ays “How did he have this canal dug out with (only) these few men?”: I swear by the god Aššur, my great god, that I dug out this canal with (only) these men. Moreover, I completed the work on it within one year (and) three months; ... was completed (and) I finished digging its excavation.
In order to open that canal, I sent an exorcist (and) a lamentation singer and ... ... Carnelian, lapis lazuli, muššāru-stone, ḫulālu-stone, pappardilû-stones, precious stones, turtles (and) tortoises whose likeness(es) are cast in silver (and) gold, aromatics, (and) fine oil, I gave as gifts to the god Ea, the lord of underground waters, cisterns, and ..., (and to) the god Enbilulu, the inspector of canals, (and) to the god Enʾeʾimdu, the lord of dike(s) and canal(s). I prayed to the great gods; they heeded my supplications and made my handiwork prosper.
This (sluice) gate of the watercourse opened by itself without (the help) of spade or shovel and let an abundance of water flow through. Its (sluice) gate was not opened through the work of human hands. According to the heart’s desire of the gods, I made (it) gurgle with water. After I inspected the canal and made sure its construction was performed correctly, I offered pure sacrifices of fattened oxen (and) an abundance of sheep to the great gods, who march at my side (and) who make my reign secure. I clothed those men who dug out this canal with linen garments (and) garments with multi-colored trim, (and) I placed gold rings (and) gold pectorals on them.
In this year with the flowing (lit. “ going ”) of this canal which I had dug, I drew up a battleline with Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), the king of the land Elam, and the king of Babylon, together with the numerous kings of the mountains and Sealand who were their allies, in the plain of the city Ḫalulê. By the command of the god Aššur, the great lord, my lord, I charged into their midst like a fierce arrow, and I repelled their troops. I dispersed their assembled host and scattered their forces.
I captured alive in the midst of battle the magnates of the king of the land Elam, including Nabû-šuma-iškun, a son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), king of the land Karduniaš (Babylonia).
Terror of doing serious battle with me overwhelmed the king of the land Elam and the king of Babylon and they released their excrement inside their chariots. In order to save their lives, they fled to their (own) land(s) and did not return ever again (saying): “Perhaps Sennacherib, king of Assyria, is so angry that he will return to the land Elam.”
Fear (and) terror fell upon all of the Elamites and they abandoned their land, and (then), in order to save their lives, they betook themselves to a rugged mountain like eagle(s) and their hearts throbbed like (those of) pursued birds. Until they died, they did not make their way (back) (lit. “they did not open a path”) and they no longer made war.
On my second campaign, I marched quickly to Babylon, which I planned to conquer, and (then) I blew like the onset of a storm and enveloped it like a (dense) fog. I besieged the city; then, by means of sapping and ladders, I captured (it) (and) plundered the city. Its people, young and old, I did not spare, and I filled the city squares with their corpses. I carried off alive to my land Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), the king of Babylon, together with his family (and) his ... s.
I handed the property of that city — silver, gold, choice stones, possessions (and) property — over to my people and they kept it for themselves. My people seized and smashed the gods living inside it, and (then) they took their possessions (and) property. The god Adad (and) the goddess Šala, gods of the city Ekallātum whom Marduk-nādin-aḫḫē, king of Akkad, had taken and brought to Babylon during the reign of Tiglath-pileser (I), king of Assyria — I had (them) brought out of Babylon after 418 years and I returned them to the city Ekallātum, their (proper) place.
I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the city, and (its) buildings, from its foundations to its crenellations. I removed the brick(s) and earth, as much as there was, from the (inner) wall and outer wall, the temples, (and) the ziggurrat, (and) I threw (it) into the Araḫtu river. I dug canals into the center of that city and (thus) leveled their site with water. I destroyed the outline of its foundations and (thereby) made its destruction surpass that of the Deluge. So that in the future, the site of that city and (its) temples will be unrecognizable, I dissolved it (Babylon) in water and annihilated (it), (making it) like a meadow.
At the “mouth” of the canal that I caused to be dug into the mountain, I ma de six steles (and) I fashioned image(s) of the great gods, my lords, upon them. Moreover, I had a royal image of myself expressing humility (lit. “one who strokes the nose”) placed before them. I had all of my handiwork that I had undertaken in Nineveh inscribed upon them and I left (them) for ever after for the kings, my descendants.
At any time (in the future), a future ruler, one of the kings, my descendants, who desecrates the work that I have done, dismantles the (canal) system that I have constructed, (or) diverts the flow of the waters of these canals from the plain of Nineveh: May the great gods, as many as are named in this stele, by their holy decree, which cannot be altered, curse him with a harsh curse and overthrow his dynasty.
The palace of Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria.
The palace of Sennacherib, king of Assyria.
Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria: Over a long distance, I had the water of the two Ḫusur Rivers (Ḫazur), the water of the Pulpulliya River, the water of the city Ḫanusa, the water of the city Gammagara, (5) (and) water from mountain springs on the right and left sides of it added to it (and thereby) I had a canal dug to the plain of Nineveh. I had an aqueduct constructed (by packing down) white limestone over deep wadis (and thereby) enabled those waters to flow over it.
Sennacherib ...: I had a canal dug over a long distance, from the Ḫusur River ... I had an aqueduct constructed (by packing down) limestone over deep wadis (and thereby) ... waters ....
At that time ... I marched quickly to Babylon and ..., the king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), who ...

I brought out ... precious stones, utensils of ... ... attendants, male singers, ... and I counted (them) as booty. ...
... his ... s, his chariots ..., the utensils of his palace, ... inside Babylon ...
On my second campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and I marched to the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians, who since time immemorial had not submitted to the kings, my ancestors.
I brought out from them ... damdāmu-mules, donkeys, oxen, and sheep and goats, and I counted (them) as booty. Moreover, I destroyed, devastated, (and) turned into ruins their small(er) settlements, which were without number.
I ... all of his wide land and overwhelmed (it) like a fog. I surrounded, conquered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Marʾubištu, Akkuddu, (and) Bīt-Bar rû, which (lie) behind the mountains, cities of his royal house, together with thirty-four small(er) settlements in their environs.

Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria: (As for) the three watercourses which (flow) from Mount Ḫāni, a mountain above the city Arbela, I dug out the springs which are on the right and left banks of those watercourses and (thus) added (the springs’ water) to them. I dug a (subterranean) watercourse and directed (all of) their course(s) inside the city Arbela, the dwelling of the goddess Ištar, the exalted lady.
The deities Aššur — great lord, the father of the gods — Anu, Enlil, and Ea, Sîn, Šamaš, Adad, Marduk, Nabû, Nergal, Ištar, (and) the Sebetti, the great gods who stand at the side of the king who reveres them and make his weapons prevail over all enemies:
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), the king who was chosen by you, guardian of truth who loves justice, renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (and) strives after good deeds, perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning:
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises. He made all of the rulers of the (four) quarters (of the world) from the Upper Sea of the Setting Sun to the Lower Sea of the Rising Sun bow down at my feet and they (now) pull my yoke. On four of my campaigns (during) which I went down to Chaldea and marched to the city Kār-Nabû, which is on the shore of the Bitter Sea, I conquered their cities, and (then) plundered (them), destroyed (them), devastated (them), (10) (and) burned (them) with fire; and on three of my campaigns (during) which I marched to Elam, I destroyed its settlements.
On my eighth campaign, I ordered the march to Babylon. (As for) the Babylonians who heard about the approach of my expeditionary force, terror and fear fell upon them. They opened the treasury of Esagil and took out the gold, silver, (and) choice stones of the god Bēl (Marduk) and the goddess Zarpanītu in abundance. They sent (it) to Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), the king of the land Elam. They wrote to him as follows: “Come to Babylon to our aid and align yourself with us! Let us put our trust in you!”
He, the king of the land Elam, was a rash fellow who does not have sense or insight. On the first occasion, in the time of Ḫallušu-(Inšušinak I), his father, I went down to his district and captured the cities Nagītu (and) Nagītu-diʾbina, (and) the lands Ḫilmu, Pillatu, and Ḫupapanu, districts of his that are on the other side of Bitter Sea, and plundered (them), destroyed (them), devastated (them), and burned (them) with fire.
On the second occasion, in the time of Kudurru (Kudur-Naḫḫunte), his brother, I went to the land Elam and, in the course of my campaign, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered the cities Bīt-Ḫaʾiri (and) Raṣā, cities on the border of Assyria that the king of the land Elam had taken away by force in the time of my ancestor(s). I had archers (and) shield bearers stationed inside them. I brought (those cities) back inside the border of Assyria and placed (them) under the authority of the garrison commander of Dēr.
The cities Bīt-Arrabi, Ālum-qašti, Bubê, Dunni-Šamaš, Ekal-šalla, Burutu, Bīt-Risiya, Dūr-Dannu-Nergal, Bīt-Aḫlamê, (25) Ālum-ša-Bēlet-bīti, Ibrat, Kuṣurtain, Dūru, Dannat-Sulāya, Šilibtu, Bīt-Aṣūsi, Kār-Zēra-iqīša, Bīt-Giṣṣi, Bīt-Katpalāni, Dimtu-ša-Sulāya, Dimtu-ša-Mār-bīti-ēṭir, Ḫarri-ašlakê, Rabbāya, Rāsu, Tīl-Uḫuri, Ḫamrānu, Tīl-Ḫumbi, Dimtu-ša-Dume-ili, Bīt-Ubiya, Baltī-līšir, Taqab-līšir, Ša-nāqidāte, Sarḫudēri, Bīt-Aḫḫē-iddina, Ilteuba, (30) Muḫuṣē..., Damtê, Dimtu-ša-Bēlet-bīti, Akkabarina, Bīt-Imbiya, Masūtu, Bīt-Unziya, Bīt-Kisiya, Dimtu-ša-Šullume, ..., Dimtu-ša-Nabû-šarḫi-ilī, Apdinu, Tīl-Raqu, Ālum-šarri, ..., the walled fortresses of the land Rāši, and the small(er) cities in their environs, which were without number, the cities Ḫamānu (and) Nadītu, as far as the pass of the land Bīt-Bunaki — I conquered, and plundered (them), (35) destroyed (them), devastated (them), burned (them) with fire, (and) turned (them) into a heap of ruins.
When he, the king of the land Elam, ... heard about the conquest of his cities, terror and fear fell upon him. He brought the rest of the people of his land into fortresses. He abandoned the city Madaktu, his royal city, and set out for the city Ḫaydala, which is in the mountains, far away.
I ordered the march to the city Madaktu, his royal city. In the month Ṭebētu (X), bitter cold set in and continuous rain fell, and (then) wind, rain, (and) snow came in equal force. I was afraid of the gorges, the outflows of the mountains, (so) I turned around and took the road to Assyria.
After my (departure), he, the king of the land Elam, rou sed ... Then, he brought down ... the rest of the people of his land, who ... fr om ... to the land ... and settled (them) on the alluvium. ... to the land ... ... ... not ha ving sense or insight ... ... ... ... ... ... he received ... ... ... He did not order their work, (but) gathered his army (and) for ces ... ... ....
... ... ... the land Bīt-Adini, ... ... ... the Ubulu, Malaḫu, Rapiqu, ...
In their multitude, ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Like a spring invasion of a swarm of locusts, ... to do battle (...) ... ... The dust of their feet covered the wide heavens like a heavy cloud in the deep of winter.
I myself prayed to the deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, Nabû, Nergal, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, the gods who support me, for victory over (my) strong enemy and they immediately heeded my prayers (and) came to my aid.
... I raged up like a ferocious ..., and (then) put on armor (and) placed a helmet suitable for combat on my head. In my anger, I rode quickly in my exalted battle chariot, which lays enemies low. I took in my hands the mighty bow that the god Aššur had granted to me ... ... my chariot on (their) flanks and front lines ....
... I roared loudly like a storm (and) thundered like the god Adad. By the command of the god Aššur, the great lord, my lord, I blew like the onset of a severe storm against the enemy. With the weapon of the god Aššur, my lord, and my fierce battle array, I turned them back and made them retreat. The massed body of troops ... ... upon them. Ḫumbān-undaša ...
(No translation possible)
his sons ... they burned ... ... ... the god Aššur, my lord ...
I quickly slaughtered and defeated his magnates, who wear gold (decorated) belt-daggers and have reddish gold sling straps fastened to their forearms, like fattened bulls restrained with fetters.
I slit their throats like sheep (and thus) cut off their precious lives like thread. Like a flood in full spate after a seasonal rainstorm ..., I made their blood flow over the broad earth. The swift thoroughbreds harnessed to my chariot plunged into floods of their blood (just) like a river. The wheels of my war chariot, which lays criminals and villains low, were bathed in blood and gore. I filled the plain with the corpses of their warriors like grass. When the second double-hour of the night had passed, I stopped their slaughter. I cut off (their) lips and (thus) destroyed their pride. I cut off their hands like the stems of cucumbers in season.
I received gold (and) shining silver sling straps from their wrists (and) slashed off their belts with sharp swords. I took away gold (and) silver (decorated) belt-daggers from their waists.
(As for) him, Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), along with the king of Babylon, terror of doing battle with me overwhelmed them like alû-demons. Their hearts throbbed like the pursued young of pigeons, they passed their urine hotly (and) they released their excrement inside their chariots. In order to save their lives, they trampled the corpses of their troops as they pushed on.
To the midst of the wagon s .... At my feet, they beseeched my lordship, (saying): “Let us live ... so that we might proclaim your fame.” After I myself had seen that they had released their excrement inside their chariots, I left them alone, sparing (their) lives.
(As for) the rest of the magnates of the land Elam, including Nabû-šuma-iškun, a son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), descendant of Yakīn, who were standing in silver (decorated) chariots, ... ..., who had raised their arms because they were terrified of (doing) serious battle with me, ... ... with the sword (and) I captured the living in the thick of battle.
I brought back all together ... the wagons along with their mules and the chariots along with with their horses, whose drivers I had killed in the thick of (that) mighty battle and which had themselves been released so that they galloped about on their own. I took away from them their camps and their royal tents. They, like runaways, returned empty-ha nded to their (own) land(s).
So that no one will ever forget the might of the god Aššur, my lord, (and) that all humanity might magnify the praise of his heroism, on the (very) spot where I defeated the king of Babylon and Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), the king of the land Elam, all of their lands, together with the lands Parsuaš, Anzan, Paširu, Ellipi, all of Chaldea, as many as there were, (and) all of the Arameans, I reaped their skulls like withered grain and piled (them) up like pyramids.
I had a stele made, had all the victorious conquests that I achieved over my enemies with the support of the great gods, my lords, written on it, and I erected (it) on the plain of the city Ḫalulê.
At that time, the city Sūr-marrati, which is on the bank of the Tigris River (and) which had been abandoned from distant days and had gone to ruin — after I myself had arranged a march to the lands Elam and Chaldea, because I had spent the night inside it in the course of my campaign, the (re)populating of that city came to my attention at that time and I put my mind to it, and (then) I greatly enlarged the site of the city, had its wall built anew, and raised (it) as high as a mountain. Beside the wall, I dug a moat around its (entire) circumference. I planted palm grove(s and) grape vine(s) in the meadow.
I had an inscribed object made and had inscribed on it all the mighty victories that I achieved over my enemies with the support of the god Aššur, my lord, and (then) I placed (it) inside the wall.
At any time (in the future), may one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur names for shepherding the land and people, renovate its dilapidated section(s) when that wall becomes old and dilapidated. May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, and return (it) to its place with his own inscription. The god Aššur will (then) hear his prayers.
Araḫsamna (VIII), the twenty-fifth day, eponymy of Nabû-kēnu-uṣur, governor of the city Samaria, fourteenth year of Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria.
Palace of Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), favorite of the great gods, wise prince, circumspect ruler, shepherd of the people, (and) leader of a widespread population, I:
The god Aššur, father of the gods, looked steadfastly upon me among all of the rulers and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises. He gave me a just scepter that widens borders (and) he put in my hand a merciless rod to fell enemies.
In a pitched battle, I overwhelmed like the Deluge Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), the king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), all of the Chaldeans and Arameans, together with the troops of the land Elam, his allies. He (Marduk-apla-iddina II) fled alone to the Sealand, and (then) he dug up the gods of the (full) extent of his land, together with the bones of his forefathers from (their) tomb(s), ... ... ...
I had inscribed on it all the mighty victories that I achieved over my enemies with the support of the god Aššur, my lord, and I deposited (it) in its foundation(s) for ever after.
At any time (in the future), may one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur names for shepherding the land and people, renovate its dilapidated section(s) when that ... becomes old and dilapidated. May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Aššur will (then) hear his prayers.

The palace of Esarhaddon, great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the four quarters, true shepherd, favorite of the great gods, (i 5) whom from his childhood the gods Aššur, Šamaš, Bēl, and Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela named for the kingship of Assyria —
I am my older brothers’ youngest brother (and) by the command of the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, and Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, (my) father, who engendered me, elevated me firmly in the assembly of my brothers, saying: ‘This is the son who will succeed me.’ He questioned the gods Šamaš and Adad by divination, and they answered him with a firm ‘yes,’ saying: ‘He is your replacement.’ (i 15) He heeded their important word(s) and gathered together the people of Assyria, young (and) old, (and) my brothers, the seed of the house of my father.
Before the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Nabû, (and) Marduk, the gods of Assyria, the gods who live in heaven and netherworld, he made them swear their solemn oath(s) concerning the safe-guarding of my succession. (i 20) In a favorable month, on a propitious day, in accordance with their sublime command, I joyfully entered the House of Succession, an awe-inspiring place within which the appointing to kingship (takes place).
Persecution (and) jealousy fell over my brothers and they forsook (the will) of the gods. They trusted in their arrogant deeds, and they were plotting evil. They started evil rumors, calumnies, (and) slander about me against the will of the gods, and they were constantly telling insincere lies, hostile things, behind my back. They alienated the well-meaning heart of my father from me, against the will of the gods, (but) deep down he was compassionate and his eyes were permanently fixed on my exercising kingship.
I pondered and thought thus: ‘Their deeds are arrogant and they trust (only) in their (own) counsel. What will they (not) do against the will of the gods?’ (i 35) I prayed to the god Aššur, king of the gods, (and) the merciful god Marduk, to whom treacherous talk is an abomination, with benedictions, supplications, and expressions of humility, and they accepted my words. By the command of the great gods, my lords, they (the gods) settled me in a secret place away from the evil deeds, (i 40) stretched out their pleasant protection over me, and kept me safe for (exercising) kingship. Afterwards, my brothers went out of their minds and did everything that is displeasing to the gods and mankind, and they plotted evil, girt (their) weapons, and in Nineveh, without the gods, they butted each other like kids for (the right to) exercise kingship.
The gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela saw the deeds of the usurpers which had been done wrongly against the will of the gods and they did not support them. They changed their strength to weakness and forced them to bow down to me. (i 50) The people of Assyria, who swore by oil and water to the treaty, an oath bound by the great gods, to protect my (right to exercise) kingship, did not come to their aid.
I, Esarhaddon, who with the help of the great gods, his lords, does not turn back in the heat of battle, quickly heard of their evil deeds. I said ‘Woe!’ and rent my princely garment. I cried out in mourning, I raged like a lion, and my mood became furious. In order to exercise kingship (over) the house of my father I beat my hands together. I prayed to the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, Nabû, and Nergal, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela (i 60) and they accepted my word(s). With their firm ‘yes,’ they were sending me reliable omen(s), (saying): ‘Go! Do not hold back! We will go and kill your enemies.’
I did not hesitate one day (or) two days. I did not wait for my army. I did not look for my rear guard. I did not check the assignment of horses harnessed to the yoke (i 65) nor that of my battle equipment. I did not stock up travel provisions for my campaign. I was not afraid of the snow (and) cold of Šabāṭu (XI), the severest cold season. Like a flying eagle I spread my wings to drive back my enemies. With difficulty and haste, I followed the road to Nineveh and (i 70) before my (arrival) in the territory of the land Ḫanigalbat all of their crack troops blocked my advance; they were sharpening their weapons. Fear of the great gods, my lords, overwhelmed them, (and when) they saw my mighty battle array, they became like crazed women.
The goddess Ištar, the lady of war and battle, who loves my priestly duties, stood at my side, broke their bows, (and) she split open their tight battle ranks. In their assembly, they said thus: ‘This is our king!’ Through her sublime command they began coming over to my side (and) marching behind me. They were gamboling like lambs (and) begging my sovereignty. (i 80) The people of Assyria, who had sworn by the treaty, an oath bound by the great gods, concerning me, came before me and kissed my feet. Moreover, those rebels, the ones engaged in revolt and rebellion, when they heard of the advance of my campaign, they deserted the army they relied on and fled to an unknown land. I reached the embankment of the Tigris River and (i 85) by the command of the gods Sîn (and) Šamaš, the divine lord(s) of the embankment, I made all of my troops hop over the wide Tigris River as if it were a small canal.
In Addaru (XII), a favorable month, on the eighth day, the eššēšu-festival of the god Nabû, I joyfully entered Nineveh, my capital city, and I sat happily on the throne of my father. The south wind, the breeze of the god Ea, the wind whose blowing is favorable for exercising kingship, blew upon me. (ii 5) Favorable signs came in good time to me in heaven and on earth. They (the gods) continually and regularly encouraged me with oracles through ecstatics, the message(s) of the gods and goddess(es). I sought out every one of the guilty soldiers, who wrongly incited my brothers to exercise kingship over Assyria, and imposed a grievous punishment on them: I exterminated their offspring.
I am Esarhaddon, king of the world, king of Assyria, valiant warrior, foremost of all rulers, son of Sennacherib, king of the world (and) king of Assyria, (ii 15) descendant of Sargon (II), king of the world (and) king of Assyria, creation of the god Aššur (and) the goddess Mullissu, beloved of the gods Sîn and Šamaš, chosen by the gods Nabû (and) Marduk, favorite of the goddess Ištar — the queen — desired by the great gods, capable, able, intelligent, learned, the one whom the great gods (ii 20) raised to be king in order to restore the great gods and to complete the shrines of all of the cult centers of the great gods; the one who (re)constructed the temple of the god Aššur, (re)built Esagil and Babylon, (and) restored the gods and goddess(es) who (live) in it; the one who returned the plundered gods of the lands from the city Aššur to their (proper) place and let (them) dwell in security —
As soon as I had completed the temples (and) had installed (them) on their daises as (their) eternal dwelling(s), with their great help I marched triumphantly from the rising sun to the setting sun and I had no rival (therein). I made the rulers of the four quarters bow down at my feet (and) they (the gods) entrusted to me (any) land that had sinned against the god Aššur.
The god Aššur, the father of the gods, gave me (the power) to let (cities) fall into ruins and to (re)populate (them, and) to enlarge Assyrian territory; the god Sîn, lord of the crown, decreed heroic strength (and) robust force as my fate; the god Šamaš, the light of the gods, elevated my important name to the highest rank; the god Marduk, king of the gods, made the fear of my kingship (ii 35) sweep over the mountain regions like a dense fog; the god Nergal, mightiest of the gods, gave me fierceness, splendor, and terror as a gift; (and) the goddess Ištar, the lady of battle and war, gave me a mighty bow (and) a fierce arrow as a present.
At that time, Nabû-zēr-kitti-līšir, son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), governor of the Sealand, who did not keep his treaty nor remember the agreement of Assyria, forgot the good relations of my father. During the disturbance(s) in Assyria, he mustered his army and his camp, besieged Ningal-iddin, the governor of Ur, a servant who was loyal to me, and (ii 45) cut off his escape route. After the gods Aššur, Šamaš, Bēl and Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela joyously seated me, Esarhaddon, on the throne of my father and handed over to me the lordship of the lands, he was not respectful, did not stop (his evil deeds), and would not leave my servant alone. Moreover, he did not send his messenger before me and did not ask after the well-being of my kingship.
I heard of his evil deeds (while) in Nineveh; my heart became angry and my liver was inflamed. I sent my officials, the governors on the border of his land, against him. Furthermore, he, Nabû-zēr-kitti-līšir, the rebel, the traitor, heard of the approach of my army and (ii 55) fled like a fox to the land Elam. Because of the oath of the great gods which he had transgressed, the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, and Nabû imposed a grievous punishment on him and they killed him with the sword in the midst of the land Elam. Naʾid-Marduk, his brother, saw the deeds that they had done to his brother in Elam, fled from the land Elam, (ii 60) came to Assyria to serve me, and beseeched my lordship. I made the entire Sealand, the domain of his brother, subject to him. (Now) he comes yearly, without ceasing, to Nineveh with his heavy audience gift and kisses my feet.
(As for) Abdi-Milkūti, king of Sidon, (who) did not fear my lordship (and) did not listen to the words of my lips, who trusted in the rolling sea and threw off the yoke of the god Aššur — I leveled Sidon, his stronghold, which is situated in the midst of the sea, like a flood, tore out its wall(s) and its dwelling(s), and (ii 70) threw (them) into the sea; and I (even) made the site where it stood disappear. Abdi-Milkūti, its king, in the face of my weapons, fled into the midst of the sea. By the command of the god Aššur, my lord, I caught him like a fish from the midst of the sea and cut off his head. I carried off his wife, his sons, his daughters, (ii 75) his palace retainers, gold, silver, goods, property, precious stones, garments with trimming and linen(s), elephant hide(s), ivory, ebony, boxwood, everything of value from his palace in huge quantities, (and) took away his far-flung people who were beyond counting, oxen, sheep and goats, and donkeys in huge numbers (ii 80) to Assyria. I gathered the kings of Ḫatti (Syria-Palestine) and the seacoast, all of them, and had (them) build a city in another place, and I named it Kār-Esarhaddon.
(The inhabitants of) the cities Bīt-Ṣupūri, Sikkû, Giʾ, Inimme, Ḫildūa, Qartimme, Biʾrû, Kilmê, Bitirume, Sagû, Ampa, (iii 5) Bīt-Gisimeya, Birgiʾ, Gambūlu, Dalaimme, (and) Isiḫimme, cities in the environs of Sidon, places of pasturing and watering for his stronghold, which I captured with the help of the god Aššur, my lord, I settled in it (iii 10) (together with) the people plundered by my bow from the eastern mountains and sea and I restored (the city) to Assyrian territory. I reorganized that province, placed my official as a governor over them, and increased and imposed upon it tribute and payment greater than before. (iii 15b) From among those cities of his I handed over the cities Maʾrubbu (and) Ṣarepta to Baʾalu, king of Tyre. I increased my lordly tribute beyond his earlier, annual giving and imposed (it) on him.
Moreover, Sanda-uarri, king of the cities Kundi and Sissû, a dangerous enemy, who did not fear my lordship (and) abandoned the gods, trusted in the impregnable mountains. He (and) Abdi-Milkūti, king of Sidon, (iii 25) agreed to help one another, swore an oath by their gods with one another, and trusted in their own strength. I trusted in the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, and Nabû, the great gods, my lords, (iii 30) besieged him, caught him like a bird from the midst of the mountains, and cut off his head. “In Tašrītu (VII) — the head of Abdi-Milkūti! In Addaru (XII) — the head of Sanda-uarri!” I beheaded (both) in the same year: (iii 35) With the former I did not delay, with the latter I was quick. To show the people the might of the god Aššur, my lord, I hung (the heads) around the necks of their nobles and I paraded in the squares of Nineveh with singer(s) and lyre(s).
I plundered the city Arzâ, which is in the district of the Brook of Egypt, and threw Asuḫīli, its king, into fetters and brought (him) to Assyria. I seated him (text: “them”), bound, near the citadel gate of (the city of) Nineveh along with bear(s), dog(s), and pig(s).
Moreover, I struck with the sword Teušpa, a Cimmerian, a barbarian whose home is remote, together with his entire army, in the territory of the land Ḫubušna.
I trod on the necks of the people of Cilicia, mountain dwellers who live in inaccessible mountains in the neighborhood of the land Tabal, evil Hittites, (iii 50) who trusted in their mighty mountains and who from earliest days had not been submissive to the yoke. I surrounded, conquered, plundered, demolished, destroyed, (and) burned with fire twenty-one of their fortified cities and small cities in their environs. (As for) the rest of them, who were not guilty of (any) sin or crime, I imposed the heavy yoke of my lordship upon them.
I crushed the wicked Barnaki, who live in the land Tīl-Ašurri, which is called Pitānu in the language of the people of the land Miḫrānu.
I scattered the Mannean people, undisciplined Gutians, and its army; I put to the sword Išpakāia, a Scythian, an ally who could not save himself.
I plundered the land Bīt-Dakkūri, which is in Chaldea, an enemy of Babylon. I captured Šamaš-ibni, its king, a rogue (and) outlaw, who did not respect the oath of the lord of lords (and) who took away fields of the citizens of Babylon (iii 65) and Borsippa by force and turned (them) over to himself. Because I know the fear of the gods Bēl and Nabû, I returned those fields and entrusted (them) to the citizens of Babylon and Borsippa. I placed Nabû-šallim, the son of Balāssu, on his throne and he (now) pulls my yoke.
(As for) Bēl-iqīša, son of Bunnannū, a Gambulian whose residence is located twelve leagues distance in water and canebrakes, by the command of the god Aššur, my lord, unprovoked fear fell upon him and (iii 75) of his own free will he took tribute and payment, uncastrated bulls, (and) teams of white mules from the land Elam and came to Nineveh, before me, and he kissed my feet. I had pity on him and encouraged him. (iii 80) I strengthened the city Ša-pī-Bēl, the city (which is) his strong fortress, and I put him together with his archers therein as a garrison and (thus) locked it (the fortress) up like a door against the land Elam.
(As for) the city Adumutu, the fortress of the Arabs, which Sennacherib, king of Assyria, (my) father, who engendered me, conquered and whose goods, possessions, (and) gods, together with Apkallatu, the queen of the Arabs, (iv 5) he plundered and brought to Assyria — Hazael, the king of the Arabs, came to Nineveh, my capital city, with his heavy audience gift and kissed my feet. He implored me to give (back) his gods, and I had pity on him. (iv 10) I refurbished the gods Atar-samayin, Dāya, Nuḫāya, Ruldāwu, Abirillu, (and) Atar-qurumâ, the gods of the Arabs, and I inscribed the might of the god Aššur, my lord, and (an inscription) written in my name on them and gave (them) back to him. (iv 15) I placed the lady Tabūa, who was raised in the palace of my father, as ruler over them and returned her to her land with her gods.
I added sixty-five camels (and) ten donkeys to the previous tribute and imposed (it) on him. Hazael died and I placed Iataʾ, his son, (iv 20) on his throne. I added ten minas of gold, one thousand choice stones, fifty camels, (and) one hundred bags of aromatics to the tribute of his father and imposed (it) on him. Later, Uabu, to exercise kingship, incited all of the Arabs to rebel against Iataʾ.
I, Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters, who loves loyalty and abhors treachery, sent my battle troops to the aid of Iataʾ, and they trampled all of the Arabs, threw Uabu, together with the soldiers who were with him, into fetters, and brought (them) to me. I placed them in neck stocks and tied them to the side of my gate.
(As for) Uppis, chieftain of the city Partakka, Zanasana, chieftain of the city Partukka, (and) Ramateia, chieftain of the city Urakazabarna, (iv 35) Medes whose country is remote (and) who had not crossed the boundary of Assyria nor trodden on its soil in (the time of) the kings, my ancestors — the awesome fear of the god Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed them (and) they brought to Nineveh, my capital city, large thoroughbreds (and) blocks of lapis lazuli, hewn from its mountain, and they kissed my feet. (iv 40) Because of the chieftains who had threatened them, they implored my lordship and begged me for help. I sent my officials, the governors of the boundary areas of their land, with them and they trampled the people living in those cities and made (them) bow down at their feet. I imposed the tribute (and) payment of my lordship upon them.
(As for) the land Patušarri, a district in the area of the salt desert, which is in the midst of the land of the distant Medes, borders Mount Bikni, the lapis lazuli mountain, (and) upon the soil of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had walked — I carried off to Assyria Šidir-parna (and) E-parna, mighty chieftains, (iv 50) who were not submissive to (my) yoke, together with their people, their riding horses, oxen, sheep and goats, (and) Bactrian camels, their heavy plunder.
(As for) the land Bāzu, a district in a remote place, a forgotten place of dry land, saline ground, a place of thirst, (iv 55) one hundred and twenty leagues of desert, thistles, and gazelle-tooth stones, where snakes and scorpions fill the plain like ants — I left Mount Ḫazû, the mountain of saggilmud-stone, twenty leagues behind me and crossed over to that district to which (iv 60) no king before me had gone since earliest days. By the command of the god Aššur, my lord, I marched triumphantly in its midst. I defeated Kīsu, king of the city Ḫaldisu, Akbaru, king of the city Ilpiatu, Mansāku, king of the city Magalani, Iapaʾ, queen of the city Diḫrāni, (iv 65) Ḫabīsu, king of the city Qadabaʾ, Niḫaru, king of the city Gaʾuani, Baslu, queen of the city Iḫilum, (and) Ḫabaziru, king of the city Pudaʾ, eight kings from that district (iv 70) (and) laid out the bodies of their warriors like (drying) malt. I carried off their gods, their goods, their possessions, and their people to Assyria. (As for) Laialê, king of the city Iadiʾ, who had fled before my weapons, unprovoked fear fell upon him, and he came to Nineveh, before me, and kissed my feet. I had pity on him and put that province of Bāzu under him.
Through the strength of the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Nabû, Marduk, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, I conquered all of (my) arrogant enemies. (iv 80) At the words of their divinity the rulers, my enemies, trembled like reeds in a storm. The kings who live in the sea, whose (inner) walls are the sea and whose outer walls are the waves, who ride in boats instead of chariots, (and) who harness rowers instead of horses, were seized by fear; their hearts were pounding and (v 1) they were vomiting gall. There was no rival that my weapons could not face and there was no one among the rulers who came before me who could equal me. Those who used to ignore the kings, my ancestors, or answer (them) constantly with hostility, by the command of the god Aššur, my lord, were delivered into my hands. (v 5) I smashed their hard stone walls like a potter’s vessel (and) let the vultures eat the unburied bodies of their warriors. I carried off their heaped-up possessions to Assyria (and) counted the gods, their helpers, as booty. I led their prosperous people away like sheep and goats.
The one who fled into the sea to save his (own) life did not escape my net and did not save himself. The swift (runner) who took to the stepped ridges of remote mountains, I caught him like a bird from the midst of the mountains and bound his arms. I made their blood flow like floodwater in mountain gullies. I ripped out the roots of the Sutû, who live in tents in a remote place, like the onslaught of a raging storm. Neither he who made the sea his fortress nor he who made the mountain his stronghold escaped my net (or) succeeded in escaping. (v 20) I ordered the (re)settling of those of the sea to the mountains (and) those of the mountains to the sea. At the command of the god Aššur, my lord, who can rival me in kingship? Moreover, who among the kings, my ancestors, was there whose dominion was as great as mine? From the midst of the sea, my enemies spoke thus: ‘Where can the fox go to get away from the sun?’
The Elamites (and) Gutians, obstinate rulers, who used to answer the kings, my ancestors, with hostility, heard of what the might of the god Aššur, my lord, had done among all of (my) enemies, and fear and terror poured over them. So that there would be no trespassing on the borders of their countries they sent their messengers (with messages) of friendship and peace to Nineveh, before me, and they swore an oath by the great gods.
After the gods Aššur, Šamaš, Bēl, Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, and Ištar of Arbela made me stand victoriously over my enemies and I attained everything I wanted, with the booty of the vast enemies which my hands had captured through the help of the great gods, my lords, I had the shrines of cult centers built in Assyria and Akkad; I decorated (them) with silver (and) gold and made (them) shine like daylight.
At that time, the armory of Nineveh which the kings who came before (me), my ancestors, had built to maintain the camp (and) to keep thoroughbreds, mules, chariots, military equipment, implements of war, and the plunder of enemies, everything (v 45) that the god Aššur, king of the gods, gave me as my royal share — that place had become too small for me to have horses show their mettle (and) to train with chariots. I made the people of the lands plundered by my bow take up hoe (and) basket, and they made bricks. I razed that small palace in its entirety, took a large area from the fields for an addition, and added (it) to it (the palace). I laid its foundations with limestone, strong stone from the mountains, and raised the terrace.
I summoned the kings of Ḫatti and Across the River (Syria-Palestine): (v 55) Baʾalu, king of Tyre, Manasseh, king of Judah, Qaʾuš-gabri, king of Edom, Muṣurī, king of Moab, Ṣil-Bēl, king of Gaza, Mitinti, king of Ashkelon, Ikausu, king of Ekron, Milki-ašapa, king of Byblos, (v 60) Mattan-Baʾal, king of Arvad, Abī-Baʾal, king of Samsimurruna, Būdi-il, king of Bīt-Ammon, Aḫī-Milki, king of Ashdod — twelve kings from the shore of the sea; Ekištūra, king of Idalion, Pilagurâ, king of Kitrusi, (v 65) Kīsu, king of Salamis, Itūandar, king of Paphos, Erēsu, king of Soloi, Damāsu, king of Curium, Admēsu, king of Tamassos, Damysos, king of Qarti-ḫadasti, (v 70) Unasagusu, king of Lidir, Buṣusu, king of Nuria — ten kings of Iadnana (Cyprus) in the midst of the sea; in total, twenty-two kings of Ḫatti (Syria-Palestine), the seacoast, and the midst of the sea.
I sent orders to all of them for large beams, tall columns, (and) very long planks (v 75) of cedar (and) cypress, grown on Mount Sirāra and Mount Lebanon, which from early days grew thick and tall, (and) they had bull colossi (made of) pendû-stone, lamassu-statues, zebus, paving stones, slabs of marble, pendû-stone, breccia, colored marble, brownish limestone, (and) girimḫilibû-stone, (everything that was) needed for my palace, dragged with much trouble (and) effort from the midst of the mountains, the place of their origin, to Nineveh, my capital city.
In a favorable month, on a propitious day, I built great palatial halls upon that terrace for my lordly residence. (vi 5) I built a royal house ninety-five large cubits long (and) thirty-one large cubits wide, something none of the kings, my ancestors, had done. I had its lower courses surrounded with limestone paving stones and I roofed it with magnificent cedar beams.
I had a room of white alabaster and palatial halls of ivory, ebony, boxwood, musukkannu-wood, cedar, (and) cypress skillfully built for my royal residence and my lordly leisure. I roofed it with magnificent cedar beams. I fastened bands of silver and copper on doors of cypress, whose fragrance is sweet, and installed (them) in their gates. (vi 15) I had placed to the right and left of their gate(s) bull colossi (and) zebus (made) of pendû-stone (and) whose appearance repels evil, large stone bull colossi, lions that are facing one another, (and) zebus that are facing one another, (and) twin lamassu-statues, that I cast in shining copper, and bull colossi (made) of white limestone.
I placed crossbeams on large copper columns (and) tall cedar columns, (thus forming) a cornice in their gates. I had the frieze(s) (and) coping(s) of the whole of that palace made of black and blue (glazed bricks) and I put (them) around (it) like a wreath. I surrounded all of the gates with an arch and a vault like a rainbow. I embedded nails of silver, gold, and shining copper in them. Through the craft of the sculptor, I depicted on it (the frieze of the palace) the might of the god Aššur, my lord, (and) the deeds that I had accomplished in enemy lands.
I planted alongside it (the palace) a botanical garden, a replica of Mount Amanus, with all kinds of aromatic plants and fruit trees. I greatly enlarged its courtyard and made its approach much wider. I led a canal into it (the park) as a watering place for horses and I made (it) murmur (with running water) like an irrigation ditch.
After I built (and) completed that palace from its foundations to its parapets (and) filled (it) with splendor, its mortar was mixed with fine beer, its kalakku-clay was mixed with wine. The bearers of the spade, the hoe, (and) the basket, the workers who carry baskets of brick(s), passed their time in joyous song, in rejoicing, with pleasure, (and) with radiant mien. I finished its work with rejoicing, jubilation, (and) melodious songs, and I named it Ešgalšiddudua, ‘The palace that administers everything.’
I invited the gods Aššur, Bēl, Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, (vi 45) the gods of Assyria, all of them, into it. I made sumptuous pure offerings before them and presented (them) with my gifts. Those gods, in their steadfast hearts, blessed my kingship. I seated all of the officials and people of my country in it (vi 50) at festive tables, ceremonial meals, and banquets, and I made their mood jubilant. I watered their insides with wine and kurunnu-wine. I had (my servants) drench their (the guests’) heads with fine oil (and) perfumed oil.
By the command of the god Aššur, the king of the gods, and the gods of Assyria, all of them, (vi 55) let me dwell in it forever in good health, happiness, bright spirit(s), (and) with the satisfaction of growing old, and let me be sated with its splendor. At new year, in the first month, yearly, without ceasing, let me inspect in it all of the thoroughbreds, mules, camels, military equipment, implements of war, (and) (vi 60) all of the captured enemy soldiers. Let the good šēdu (and) the good lamassu, who guard my royal path (and) who make me happy, last forever and ever in that palace. May they never leave it.
In the future, may one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar name to rule the land and people, renovate the dilapidated section(s) of that palace when it becomes old and dilapidated. Just as I placed an inscription written in the name of the king, (my) father, who engendered me, (vi 70) beside an inscription written in my name, so you (too) should be like me (and) read an inscription written in my name, anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, and place (it) beside an inscription written in your name. The god Aššur and the goddess Ištar will (then) hear your prayers.

The palace of Esarhaddon, great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, (i 5) son of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, descendant of Sargon (II), king of Assyria, the king who with the help of the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Nabû, Marduk, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, (i 10) the great gods, his lords, marched from the rising sun to the setting sun and had no equal (therein);
the one who conquered the city Sidon, which is in the midst of the sea, (i 15) (and) the one who leveled all of its dwellings — I tore out its wall(s) and its dwelling(s), and threw (them) into the sea; and I (even) made the site where it stood disappear. I caught Abdi-Milkūti, its king, (i 20) who had fled in the face of my weapons into the midst of the sea, like a fish from the midst of the sea and cut off his head. I carried off his amassed possessions, gold, silver, precious stones, (i 25) elephant hide(s), ivory, ebony, boxwood, garments with trimming and linen(s), everything of value from his palace in huge quantities, (and) took away his far-flung people who were beyond counting, oxen, sheep and goats, (and) donkeys (i 30) to Assyria. I gathered the kings of Ḫatti (Syria-Palestine) and the seacoast, all of them, and had (them) build a city in another place, and I named it Kār-Esarhaddon. (i 35) I settled in it people plundered by my bow from the eastern mountains and sea (and) I placed my official as governor over them.
Moreover, Sanda-uarri, king of the cities Kundi (and) Sissû, a dangerous enemy, who did not fear my lordship (and) abandoned the gods, trusted in the impregnable mountains. Furthermore, Abdi-Milkūti, king of Sidon, agreed to help him (i 45) and they swore an oath by the great gods with one another and trusted in their own strength. I trusted in the god Aššur, my lord, caught him like a bird from the midst of the mountains, and cut off his head. (i 50) To show the people the might of the god Aššur, my lord, I hung the heads of Sanda-uarri and Abdi-Milkūti around the necks of their nobles and (i 55) I paraded in the squares of Nineveh with singers and lyre(s).
The one who plundered the land Arzâ, which is in the district of the Brook of Egypt — I threw Asuḫīli, its king, into fetters along with his counselors and (i 60) brought (them) to Assyria. I seated them, bound, near the citadel gate of (the city of) Nineveh along with bear(s), dog(s), and pig(s).
Moreover, I struck with the sword Teušpa, a Cimmerian, a barbarian whose home is remote, together with his entire army, in the territory of the land Ḫubušna.
The one who treads on the necks of the people of Cilicia, mountain dwellers who live in mountains in the neighborhood of Tabal, who trusted in their mountains and who from earliest days had not been submissive to the yoke — I surrounded, conquered, plundered, demolished, destroyed, (and) burned with fire (ii 10) twenty-one of their cities together with small cities in their environs. (As for) the rest of them, who were not guilty of (any) sin or crime, I imposed the heavy yoke of my lordship upon them.
The one who crushed the Barnaki, a dangerous enemy, who live in the land Tīl-Ašurri, which is called Pitānu in the language of the people of the city Miḫrānu;
the one who scattered the Mannean people, undisciplined Gutians, who put to the sword the army of Išpakāia, a Scythian, an ally who could not save himself;
the one who drove out Nabû-zēr-kitti-līšir, son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), who had put his trust in the king of the land Elam, but could not save his life — Naʾid-Marduk, his brother, fled from the land Elam to serve me, (ii 30) came to Nineveh, my capital city, and kissed my feet. I made the entire Sealand, the domain of his brother, subject to him.
The one who sacked the land Bīt-Dakkūri, which is in Chaldea, an enemy of Babylon; the one who captured Šamaš-ibni, its king, a rogue (and) outlaw, who did not respect the oath of the lord of lords (and) who took away fields of the citizens of Babylon and Borsippa by force — (ii 40) because I know the fear of the gods Bēl and Nabû, I returned those fields and entrusted (them) to the citizens of Babylon and Borsippa. I placed Nabû-šallim, the son of Balāssu, on his throne and he (now) pulls my yoke.
(As for) the city Adumutu, the fortress of the Arabs, which Sennacherib, king of Assyria, (my) father, who engendered me, conquered and whose goods, possessions, (and) gods, together with Apkallatu, the queen of the Arabs, he plundered and brought to Assyria — Hazael, the king of the Arabs, came to Nineveh, my capital city, with his heavy audience gift and kissed my feet. (ii 55) He implored me to give (back) his gods, and I had pity on him. I refurbished those gods and I had the might of the god Aššur, my lord, and (an inscription) written in my name inscribed on them and I gave (them) back to him. (ii 60) I placed the lady Tabūa, who was raised in my palace, as ruler over them and returned her to her land with her gods.
I added sixty-five camels to the previous tribute (which was paid to) my father and imposed (it) on him. Later, Hazael died and I placed Iaʾlû (Iataʾ), his son, (iii 5) on his throne. I added ten minas of gold, one thousand choice stones, fifty camels, (and) one thousand bags of aromatics to the tribute of his father and imposed (it) on him.
(As for) the land Bāzu, a district in a remote place, a forgotten place of dry land, saline ground, a place of thirst, one hundred and forty leagues of desert, thistles, and gazelle-tooth stones, twenty leagues of land where snakes and scorpions fill the plain like ants — (iii 15) I left mount Ḫazû, the mountain of saggilmud-stone, twenty leagues behind me and crossed over (to that district) to which no king before me had gone since earliest days. By the command of the god Aššur, my lord, (iii 20) I marched triumphantly in its midst. I defeated eight kings from that district (and) carried off their gods, their goods, their possessions, (and) their people to Assyria. Laialê, king of the city Iadiʾ, (iii 25) who had fled before my weapons, heard of the plundering of his gods and came to Nineveh, my capital city, before me, and kissed my feet. (iii 30) I had pity on him and said to him ‘ Aḫulap! ’ I inscribed the might of the god Aššur, my lord, on his gods that I had carried off and I gave (them) back to him. I put that province of Bāzu under him (and) imposed on him my lordly tribute (and) payment.
(As for) Bēl-iqīša, son of Bunnannū, a Gambulian whose residence is located twelve leagues distance in water and swamps like (that of) a fish, (iii 40) by the command of the god Aššur, my lord, fear fell upon him and of his own free will he took tribute and payment, uncastrated bulls, (and) teams of white mules from the land Elam (and) brought (them) to Nineveh, before me, (iii 45) and he kissed my feet. I had pity on him and encouraged him. I strengthened the city Ša-pī-Bēl, the city (which is) his strong fortress, and (iii 50) I put him together with his archers therein as a garrison and (thus) locked it (the fortress) up like a door against the land Elam.
(As for) the land Patušarri, a district in the area of the salt desert, which is in the midst of the land of the distant Medes, (iii 55) borders Mount Bikni, the lapis lazuli mountain, (and) upon the soil of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had walked — I carried off to Assyria Šidir-parna (and) E-parna, mighty chieftains, who were not submissive to (my) yoke, together with their people, their riding horses, oxen, sheep and goats, donkeys, (and) Bactrian camels, their heavy plunder.
(As for) Uppis, chieftain of the city Partakka, Zanasana, chieftain of the city Partukka, (and) Ramateia, chieftain of the city Urakazabarna, Medes whose country is remote (iv 5) (and) who had not crossed the boundary of Assyria nor trodden on its soil in the time of the kings, my ancestors — the awesome fear of the god Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed them and they brought to Nineveh, my capital city, large thoroughbreds (and blocks of) lapis lazuli, hewn from its mountain, (iv 10) and they kissed my feet. Because of the chieftains who had threatened them, they implored my lordship and begged me for help. I sent my officials, the governors (iv 15) of the boundary areas of their land, with them and they trampled the people living in those cities and made (them) bow down at their feet. I imposed the tribute (and) payment of my lordship upon them yearly.
After the gods Aššur, Šamaš, Bēl and Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela made me stand victoriously over my enemies and I attained everything I wanted, with the booty of the vast enemies which my hands had captured through the help of the great gods, my lords, I had the shrines of cult centers built in Assyria and Akkad; I decorated (them) with silver (and) gold and made (them) shine like daylight.
At that time, the armory of Nineveh which the kings who came before (me), my ancestors, (iv 35) had built to maintain the camp (and) to keep thoroughbreds, mules, chariots, military equipment, implements of war, and the plunder of enemies, everything that the god Aššur, king of the gods, (iv 40) gave me as my royal share — that place had become too small for me to have horses show their mettle (and) to train with chariots. I made the people of the lands plundered by my bow (iv 45) take up hoe (and) basket, and they made bricks. I razed that small palace in its entirety, took a large area from the fields for an addition, and added (it) to it (the palace). I raised the terrace with limestone, strong stone from the mountains.
I summoned twenty-two kings of Ḫatti (Syria-Palestine), the seacoast, and the midst of the sea, and I sent orders to all of them for large beams, tall columns, (and) planks of cedar (and) cypress from Mount Sirāra (and) Mount Lebanon, (and) they had lamassu-statues, zebus, paving stones, slabs (v 5) of marble, pendû-stone, breccia, colored marble, engišû-stone, brownish limestone, (and) girimḫilibû-stone, (v 10) (everything that was) needed for my palace, dragged with much trouble (and) effort from the midst of the mountains, the place of their origin, to Nineveh.
In a favorable month, on a propitious day, I built great palatial halls upon that terrace for my lordly residence. I built a great (royal) house ninety-five large cubits long (and) thirty-one large cubits wide, (v 20) something none of the kings who came before (me), my ancestors, had done. I roofed it with magnificent cedar beams. I fastened bands of silver and bronze on doors of cypress, whose fragrance is sweet, and installed (them) in its gates.
I had stone šēdu s and lamassu s, whose appearance repels evil, placed to the right and the left of their gate(s) as (v 30) protectors of the walk (and) guardians of the path of the king who made them. I had the palace (v 35) skillfully built of interlocking limestone and cedar for my lordly pleasure. I set up inside it twin copper lamassu-statues, with each pair looking (both) forward and backward.
I placed crossbeams on tall cedar columns (thus forming) a cornice in their gates. I had the frieze(s) (and) coping(s) of the whole of that palace made of black (and) blue (glazed bricks) and I put (them) around (it) like a wreath. (v 45) I surrounded all of the gates with an arch (and) a vault like a rainbow. I embedded nails of pure silver and shining bronze in them. Through the craft of the sculptor, I depicted on it (the frieze of the palace) the might of the god Aššur, my lord, (the deeds) that I had accomplished in enemy lands.
I set up alongside it (the palace) a botanical garden, a replica of Mount Amanus, with all kinds of aromatic plants and fruit trees. I greatly enlarged its courtyard and made its approach much wider.

I built a great (royal) house ninety-five large cubits long (and) thirty-one large cubits wide, (v 10′) something none of kings who came before (me), my ancestors, had done. I roofed it with magnificent cedar beams. I fastened bands of silver and bronze on doors of cypress, whose fragrance is sweet, and installed (them) in its gates.
I had stone šēdu s and lamassu s, whose appearance repels evil, placed to the right and the left of their gate(s) as protectors of the walk (and) guardians of the path of the king who made them. I had the palace skillfully built of interlocking limestone and cedar, for my lordly pleasure. I set up inside it twin copper lamassu-statues, with each pair looking (both) forward and backward.
I placed crossbeams on tall cedar columns (thus forming) a cornice in their gates. I had the frieze(s) (and) coping(s) of the whole of that palace made of black (and) blue (glazed bricks) and I put (them) around (it) like a wreath. I surrounded all of the gates with an arch (and) a vault like a rainbow. I embedded nails of pure silver and shining bronze in them. Through the craft of the sculptor, I depicted on it (the frieze of the palace) the might of the god Aššur, my lord, (the deeds) that I had accomplished in enemy lands.
I set up alongside it (the palace) a botanical garden, a replica of Mount Amanus, with all kinds of aromatic plants and fruit trees.
... ... I made their mood jubilant. I watered their insides with wine (and) kurunnu-wine. I had (my servants) drench their (the guests’) heads with fine oil (and) perfumed oil.
By the command of the god Aššur, the king of the gods, and the gods of Assyria, all of them, let me dwell in it forever in good health, happiness, bright spirit(s), (and) with the satisfaction of growing old, and (vi 10′) let me be sated with its splendor. At new year, in the first month, yearly, without ceasing, let me inspect in it all of the thoroughbreds, mules, donkeys, camels, military equipment, implements of war, (and) all of the captured enemy soldiers. (vi 17′) Let the good lamassu (and) the good šēdu, who guard my royal path (and) who make me happy, last forever and ever in that palace. May they never leave it.
In the future, may one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar name to rule the land and people, renovate the dilapidated section(s) of that palace when it becomes old and dilapidated. Just as I placed an inscription written in the name of the king, (my) father, who engendered me, beside an inscription written in my name, so you (too) should be like me and read an inscription written in my name, anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) place (it) beside an inscription written in your name. The god Aššur and the goddess Ištar will (then) hear your prayers.

Moreover, I struck with the sword Teušpa, a Cimmerian, a barbarian whose home is remote, together with his entire army, in the territory of the land Ḫubušna.
The one who treads on the necks of the people of Cilicia, mountain dwellers who live in inaccessible mountains in the neighborhood of the land Tabal, evil Hittites, who from earliest days had not been submissive to the yoke — I surrounded, conquered, plundered, demolished, destroyed, (and) burned with fire twenty-one of their fortified cities and small cities in their environs. (As for) the rest of them, who were not guilty of (any) sin or crime, I imposed the heavy yoke of my lordship upon them.

(As for) the city Adumutu, the fortress of the Arabs, which Sennacherib, king of Assyria, (my) father, who engendered me, conquered and whose goods, possessions, (and) gods, together with Apkallatu, the queen of the Arabs, he plundered and brought to Assyria — Hazael, the king of the Arabs, (ii′ 10′) came to Nineveh, my capital city, with his heavy audience gift and kissed my feet. He implored me to give (back) his gods and I had pity on him. I refurbished ... ... ... and I inscribed the might of the god Aššur, my lord,
I added ... fifty camels, (and) one thousand bags of aromatics to the tribute of his father and imposed (it) on him.
(As for) the land Bāzu, a district in a remote place, a forgotten place of dry land, saline ground, a place of thirst, one hundred and twenty leagues of desert, thistles, and gazelle-tooth stones, where snakes and scorpions fill the plain like ants — I left (ii′ 30′) Mount Ḫazû, the mountain of saggilmud-stone, twenty leagues behind me and crossed over to that district to which no king before me had gone since earliest days. By the command of the god Aššur, my lord, I marched triumphantly in its midst. I defeated eight kings from that district (and) carried off their gods, their goods, their possessions, (and) their people to Assyria.
I locked it (the fortress) up like a door against the land Elam.
(As for) the land Patušarri, a district in the area of the salt desert, which is in the midst of the land of the distant Medes, borders on Mount Bikni, the lapis lazuli mountain, (iii′ 5′) (and) upon the soil of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had walked — I carried off to Assyria Šidir-parna (and) E-parna, mighty chieftains, who were not submissive to (my) yoke, together with their people, their riding horses, oxen, sheep and goats, donkeys, (and) Bactrian camels, their heavy plunder.
(As for) Uppis, chieftain of the city Partakka, Zanasana, chieftain of the city Partukka, (and) Ramateia, chieftain of the city Urakazabarna, Medes whose country is remote (and) who had not crossed the boundary of Assyria nor trodden on its soil in the time of the kings, my ancestors —
I am my older brothers’ youngest brother (and) by the command of the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl and Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, (my) father, who engendered me, elevated me firmly in the assembly of my brothers, (i 5′) saying: ‘This is the son who will succeed me.’ He questioned the gods Šamaš and Adad by divination, and they answered him with a firm ‘yes,’ saying: ‘He is your replacement.’ He heeded their important word(s) and gathered together the people of Assyria, young (and) old, (and) my brothers, the seed of the house of my father.
Before the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Nabû, (and) Marduk, the gods of Assyria, the gods who live in heaven and netherworld, he made them swear their solemn oath(s) concerning the safe-guarding of my succession. In a favorable month, on a propitious day, in accordance with their sublime command, I joyfully entered the House of Succession, an awe-inspiring place within which the appointing to kingship (takes place).
... that place had become too small for me to have horses show their mettle (and) to train with chariots. I made the people of the lands plundered by my bow take up hoe and basket, and they made bricks. I razed that small palace in its entirety, took a large area from the fields for an addition, and added (it) to it (the palace). I laid its foundations with limestone, strong stone from the mountains, and raised the terrace.
I summoned the kings of Ḫatti and Across the River (Syria-Palestine): Baʾalu, king of Tyre, Manasseh, king of Judah, Qaʾuš-gabri, king of Edom, Muṣurī, king of Moab, Ṣil-Bēl, king of Gaza, Mitinti, king of Ashkelon, (vi 10′) Ikausu, king of Ekron, Milki-ašapa, king of Byblos, Mattan-Baʾal, king of Arvad, Abī-Baʾal, king of Samsimurruna, Būdi-il, king of Bīt-Ammon, Aḫī-Milki, king of Ashdod — twelve kings from the shore of the sea; Ekištūra, king of Idalion, Pilagurâ, king of Kitrusi, Kīsu, king of Salamis,
... ... ... I cried out in mourning, I raged like a lion, and my mood became furious. In order to exercise kingship (over) the house of my father I beat my hands together. I prayed to the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, Nabû, and Nergal, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela and they accepted my word(s). With their firm ‘yes’, they were sending me reliable omen(s), (saying): ‘Go! Do not hold back! We will go and kill your enemies.’
I did not hesitate one day (or) two days. I did not wait for my army. I did not look for my rear guard. I did not check the assignment of horses harnessed to the yoke nor that of my battle equipment. I did not stock up travel provisions for my campaign. I was not afraid of the snow (and) cold of Šabāṭu (XI), the severest cold season. Like a flying eagle I spread my wings to drive back my enemies. ... ...
... ... ... and they killed him with the sword in the midst of the land Elam. Naʾid-Marduk, his brother, saw the deeds that they had done to his brother in Elam, fled from the land Elam, (ii′ 5′) came to Assyria to serve me, and beseeched my lordship. I made the entire Sealand, the domain of his brother, subject to him. (Now) he comes yearly, without ceasing, to Nineveh, my capital city, with his heavy audience gift and kisses my feet.
In my second campaign, (as for) Abdi-Milkūti, king of Sidon, (who) did not fear my lordship (and) did not listen to the words of my lips, who trusted in the rolling sea and threw off the yoke of the god Aššur — I leveled Sidon, his stronghold, which is situated in the midst of the sea, like a flood, tore out its wall(s) and its dwelling(s), and threw (them) into the sea; and I (even) made the site where it stood disappear.
Abdi-Milkūti, its king, in the face of my weapons, fled into the midst of the sea. By the command of the god Aššur, my lord, I caught him like a fish from the midst of the sea and cut off his head. I carried off his wife, his sons, his daughters, his palace retainers, silver, gold, (ii′ 20′) goods and property, precious stones, garments with trimming and linen(s), everything of value from his palace in huge quantities, (and) took away (his) far-flung people (who were) beyond counting, oxen, sheep and goats, (and) donkeys in huge numbers to Assyria. I gathered the kings of Ḫatti (Syria-Palestine) and the seacoast, all of them, and had (them) build a city in another place, and I named it Kār-Esarhaddon.
(The inhabitants of) the cities Bīt-Ṣupūri, Sikkû, Giʾ, Inimme, Ḫildūa, Qartimme, Biʾrû, Kilmê, Bitirume, Sagû, Ampa, Bīt-Gisimeya, Birgiʾ, (ii′ 30′) Gambūlu, Dalaimme, (and) Isiḫimme, cities in the environs of Sidon, places of pasturing and watering for his stronghold, which I captured with the help of the god Aššur, my lord, I settled in it (together with) the people plundered by my bow from the eastern mountains and sea and I restored (the city) (ii′ 35′) to Assyrian territory. I reorganized that province, placed my official as a governor over them, and increased and imposed upon it tribute and payment greater than before.
Moreover, Sanda-uarri, king of the cities Kundi and Sissû, a dangerous enemy, who did not fear my lordship (and) abandoned the gods, (ii′ 40′) trusted in the impregnable mountains. He (and) Abdi-Milkūti, king of Sidon, agreed to help one another, swore an oath by their gods with one another, and trusted in their own strength. I trusted in the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, and Nabû, (ii′ 45′) the great gods, my lords, besieged him, caught him like a bird from the midst of the mountains, and cut off his head. “In Tašrītu (VII) — the head of Abdi-Milkūti! In Addaru (XII) — the head of Sanda-uarri!” I beheaded (both) in the same year: With the former I did not delay, (...)
whose goods, possessions, (and) gods, together with Apkallatu, the queen of the Arabs, he (Sennacherib) plundered and brought to Assyria — Hazael, the king of the Arabs, came to Nineveh, my capital city, with his heavy audience gift and kissed my feet. He implored me to give (back) his gods, and (iii′ 5′) I had pity on him. I refurbished the gods Atar-samayin, Dāya, Nuḫāya, Ruldāwu, Abirillu, (and) Atar-qurumâ, the gods of the Arabs, and I inscribed the might of the god Aššur, my lord, and (an inscription) written in my name on them and gave (them) back to him. I placed the lady Tabūa, who was raised in the palace of my father, as ruler over them and returned her to her land with her gods.
I added sixty-five camels (and) ten donkeys to the previous tribute and imposed (it) on him. Hazael died and I placed Iataʾ, his son, on his throne. I added ten minas of gold, one hundred choice stones, fifty camels, (and) (iii′ 15′) one hundred bags of aromatics to the tribute of his father and imposed (it) on him. Later, Uabu, to exercise kingship, incited all of the Arabs to rebel against Iataʾ.
I, Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters, who loves loyalty and abhors treachery, sent (iii′ 20′) my battle troops to the aid of Iataʾ, and they trampled all of the Arabs, threw Uabu, together with the soldiers who were with him, into fetters, and brought (them) to me. I placed them in neck stocks and tied them to the side of my gate.
(As for) Uppis, chieftain of the city Partakka, Zanasana, chieftain of the city Partukka, (and) Ramateia, chieftain of the city Urakazabarna, Medes whose country is remote (and) who had not crossed the boundary of Assyria nor trodden on its soil in (the time of) the kings, my ancestors — (iii′ 30′) the awesome fear of the god Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed them (and) they brought to Nineveh, my capital city, large thoroughbreds (and) blocks of lapis lazuli, hewn from its mountain, and ...
and its army; I put to the sword Išpakāia, a Scythian, an ally who could not save himself.
I plundered the land Bīt-Dakkūri, which is in Chaldea, an enemy of Babylon. I captured Šamaš-ibni, its king, a rogue (and) outlaw, (i′ 5′) who did not respect the oath of the lord of lords, who took away fields of the citizens of Babylon and Borsippa by force and turned (them) over to himself. Because I know the fear of the gods Bēl and Nabû, I returned those fields and entrusted (them) to the citizens of Babylon and Borsippa. I placed Nabû-šallim, son of Balāssu, on his throne and he (now) pulls my yoke.
(As for) Bēl-iqīša, son of Bunnannū, a Gambulian whose residence is located twelve leagues distance in water and swamps, by the command of the god Aššur, my lord, unprovoked fear fell upon him and of his own free will he took tribute and payment,
who ... to the land ...; they did not listen .... The people of Assyria, who had committed sin(s), ... robbers, thieves, murderers, ... (ii′ 5′) (those people) who did not fear the oath of his lord, ... overseers, leaders, soldiers, ... or those who ... at the feet ... .... They stole ... ... ... to his land ... ... to take revenge ...
I sent my officials, the governors of the boundary areas of their land, with them and they trampled the people living in those cities (and) made (them) bow down at their feet. I imposed the tribute (and) payment of my lordship upon them.
(As for) the land Patušarri, a district in the area of the salt desert, which is in the midst of the land of the distant Medes, borders Mount Bikni, the lapis lazuli mountain, (and) upon the soil of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had walked — I carried off to Assyria Šidir-parna (and) E-parna, mighty chieftains, who were not submissive to (my) yoke, together with their people, (i′ 10′) their riding horses, oxen, sheep and goats, (and) Bactrian camels, their heavy plunder.
In my ... th campaign, (as for) the land Bāzu, a district in a remote place, a forgotten place of dry land, saline ground, a place of thirst, one hundred and twenty leagues of desert, thistles, and gazelle-tooth stones, (i′ 15′) where snakes and scorpions fill the plain like ants — I left Mount Ḫazû, the mountain of saggilmud-stone, twenty leagues behind me and crossed over to that district to which no king before me had gone since earliest days. By the command of the god Aššur, my lord, I marched triumphantly in its midst. I defeated Kīsu, king of the land Ḫaldisu, (i′ 20′) Akbaru, king of the city Ilpiatu, Mansāku, king of the land Magalani, Iapaʾ, queen of the land Diḫrāni, Ḫabīsu, king of the city Qadabaʾ, Niḫaru, king of the city Gaʾuani, Baslu, queen of the city Iḫilum, ... ...
before ... on the third day, in the evening ... the festival of Erua, (that is) Zarpanītu, I prayed to the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Adad, Bēl, Bēltīya, Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (ii′ 5′) Ištar of Arbela, and Gušea, the gods, my helpers, and they heard my prayers. I raged like a lion, put on (my) coat of mail, (and) put on (my head) a helmet appropriate for battle. I held in my hands the mighty bow (and) the strong arrow, which the god Aššur, king of the gods, placed in my hands. (ii′ 10′) Like a furious eagle, my wings were spread before my army (and) I was marching like the flood. The merciless arrow (bestowed) by the god Aššur shot out angrily (and) furiously .... The gods Šarur (and) Šargaz were marching at my side. By the command of the god Aššur, the king of the gods, my lord, I prayed to the great gods and they heard my prayers (and) ....
I, Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, the center of my army, the army of the land .... I was following their great divinity. With their great help, I blew between them like the onslaught of a raging storm, dispersed their concentrated troops, overwhelmed his troops, ..., (ii′ 20′) the leaders of his army, his brothers, his governors, (and) his third-men from the city Išḫupri to Memphis, a distance of fifteen days march.

Nabû-zēr-kitti-līšir, son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), the rebel, the traitor, heard of the approach of my army and fled like a fox to the land Elam. Because he failed to keep the oath of the god Aššur, his lord, they killed him with the sword in the midst of the land Elam. (10′) Naʾid-Marduk saw what they had done to his brother in Elam and he came to Assyria, before me, and kissed my feet. I made the domain of his brother subject to him and imposed my lordly tribute on him.
(As for) Bēl-iqīša, whose residence is located twelve leagues distance in the midst of swamps (and) canebrakes, the awe-inspiring terror of my lordship overwhelmed him and unprovoked fear fell upon him. He came before me to serve (me) and (now) he kisses my feet.
(The people of) the city Arzâ, whose king Asuḫīli threw off my yoke, I threw them into fetters and brought (them) to Assyria.
I struck with the sword Teušpa, a Cimmerian, with his entire army, in the (territory of) the land Ḫubušna, (and) I imposed upon him a heavy tribute.

Nabû-zēr-kitti-līšir, the rebel, the traitor, heard of the approach of my army and fled like a fox to the land Elam. Because of the oath of the great gods which he had transgressed, the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, and Nabû imposed a grievous punishment on him and they killed him with the sword in the midst of the land Elam. (5′) Naʾid-Marduk, his brother, saw the evil deeds that they had done to his brother in Elam, he fled from the land Elam to save his life, and came to Assyria, before me. I had pity on Naʾid-Marduk and Ummanigaš (Ḫuban-ḫaltaš), his brother, (and) I made the Sealand subject to him (Naʾid-Marduk). I imposed upon him the tribute and payment of my lordship yearly, without ceasing.
(As for) Bēl-iqīša, son of Bunnannū, a Gambulian whose residence is located twelve leagues distance in swamps (and) canebrakes, (10′) fear of the god Aššur, king of the gods, and the awesomeness of my lordship overwhelmed him, and unprovoked fear fell upon him. He brought tribute and payment, yearly, without ceasing, before me, in Nineveh. I had pity on him and encouraged him. I strengthened Ša-pī-Bēl, the city (which is) his strong fortress, and I put him together with his archers therein as a garrison and (thus) locked it (the fortress) up like a door against the land Elam.
I conquered the city Arzâ, which is in the district of the Brook of Egypt, and threw Asuḫīli, its king, together with his counselors, into fetters and brought (him) to Assyria, together with his heavy audience gift. I bound him like a pig near the citadel gate of (the city of) Nineveh (and) seated him therein.
The awesomeness of my lordship overwhelmed Hazael, and he brought with (him) gold, silver, (and) precious stones, his heavy audience gift, to Nineveh, before me, and kissed my feet. I added sixty-five camels (and) ten donkeys to the tribute (which was paid to) my father and (rev. 5) imposed (it) on him. Later, Hazael died and I placed Iaʾutâ (Iataʾ), his son, on his throne. I added ten minas of gold, one thousand choice stones, fifty camels, (and) one hundred bags of aromatics to the tribute of his father and imposed (it) on him. Uabu, the king of ..., to exercise kingship, incited all of the Arabs to rebel against Iaʾutâ (Iataʾ).
I, Esarhaddon, who loves loyalty and abhors treachery, sent archers, cavalry, (and) forces to the aid of Iaʾutâ (Iataʾ). I subdued and subjected (Uabu) for him. I threw Uabu, together with all of the soldiers who were with him, into fetters and brought (them) here and bound them to the left side of the citadel gate of the city of Nineveh.

He (Nabû-zēr-kitti-līšir) fled like a fox to the land Elam. Because of the oath of the great gods (which he had transgressed), the gods Aššur (and) Šamaš imposed a grievous punishment on him and they killed him with the sword in the midst of the land Elam. Naʾid-Marduk, his brother, saw the deeds that they had done to his brother in Elam.
... who did not keep the oath of the god Aššur, king of the gods, who did not fear my lordship, ... ..., robbers, thieves, or those who had sinned, those who had shed blood, ... officials, governors, overseers, leaders, (and) soldiers who fled to the land Šubria ... thus I wrote to him, (saying): “Have a herald summon these people in your land and (ii 5) ... gather them and do not release a single man; ... have them brought before the goddess Piriggal, the great lady, in the temple; ... ... a message concerning the preservation of their lives ... ... let them take the road to Assyria with my messenger.”
... he forgot the good ... that saved his life ... s of Assyria, my servants, before him ... ... ... together with a standard in the hands of the messenger of .... He repeated to me whatever they answered him. ... my mood became angry ... ... ... ... ...
He heard my royal message, which burns my enemy like a flame, and he doubled over at the hips; his heart stopped and his knees trembled. He tore off his royal garment and clothed his body with sackcloth, the garment of a sinner. His appearance became miserable and he became like a slave and counted himself among his servants. With entreaty, prayer, expressions of humility, kneeling against the wall of his city, he was bitterly crying ‘woe,’ beseeching my lordship with open hands, (and) saying ‘ Aḫulap! ’ again and again to the heroic Aššur, my lord, and the praise of my heroism.
Thus he wrote to me, (saying): “O, king, to whom abomination, untruth, plundering, (and) murdering are taboo; trustworthy shepherd, who keeps safe his camp, the strength of his army, whose attack can not be withstood, knowledgeable in battle, war, (and) combat, capable in all deeds, for whom the god Aššur made mighty his weapons and whom he made greater than the kings, his ancestors — let the land Šubria, the land that sinned against you, serve you in its entirety. Place your official over them and let them pull your yoke! Lay tribute (and) payment upon them, yearly, without ceasing! I am a thief (and) for the sin I have committed I will restore the losses fifty-fold.
“For each runaway Assyrian fugitive, let me replace him one hundred-fold. Let me live so that I may proclaim the fame of the god Aššur (and) praise your heroism. May the one who is neglectful of the god Aššur, king of the gods, the one who does not listen to the word of Esarhaddon, king of the world, his lord, (and) the one who does not return runaway Assyrian fugitives to his owner, learn from my example. (i 20) (I said) thus: ‘The nobles, my advisors, spoke unwholesome lies to me. (Consequently) I committed a great sin against the god Aššur and (thus) I did not listen to the word of the king, my lord, did not return to you the citizens of Assyria, your servants, nor did I do myself (any) good. (Now) the oath of the great gods, which I transgressed, (and) the word of your kingship, which I despised, have caught up with me. May the anger of your heart be appeased. Have mercy on me and remove my punishment!’”
I, Esarhaddon, mighty king, whose word is immutable, whose princely command cannot be annulled, who does not turn back from unsheathed weapons and the onslaught of fierce battle, whose battle none of the kings among all of (his) enemies ever sought a second time (and) before whom no ruler, his opponent, (ever) stood in the place of battle,
thus I said to him, (saying): “Did you ever hear a mighty king (give his) order twice? But I am an almighty king (and) I have written to you three times (and) you have not listened to the words of my lips! You had no fear of deceiving me and you paid no attention to my message(s). You began war and battle against me and (by so doing) you called up the fierce weapons of the god Aššur from their sheaths.”
I did not listen to his prayer, did not accept his plea, did not admit his entreaty, (and) did not turn back my anger from him. My fury did not relent towards him; my angry heart was not appeased. I had no pity for him and did not say ‘ Aḫulap! ’ to him.
Moreover, against the city Uppume, his royal city, which is situated like a cloud atop a mighty mountain, I had soldiers construct, laboriously (and) with great difficulty, a ramp by piling up dirt, wood, and stones. I made (it) taboo for him (to stand) atop the wall of his city. ...
While I was marching about victoriously in the midst of that district, in Ululu (VI), the twenty-first day, an evil day, a bad day, the birth(day) of the asakku-demon, in the dead of night, they sprinkled with naphtha the ramp that I constructed against Uppume, his royal city, and set fire (to it). (ii 5) By the command of the god Marduk, king of the gods, the north wind, the sweet breeze of the lord of the gods, blew and turned the tongue(s) of roaring flame back on the city Uppume. (The fire) did not seize the ramp ... it burned its wall and turned (it) into ashes. ... (my troops) crossed over the siege wall to do battle and combat; ... they attacked them like a ... and established their defeat. (ii 10) ... ... them and they built towers of their skulls; they hung their ... on stakes and completely surrounded their city (with them). After I achieved my victory and did everything I pleased, I took ... and set up my camp by the city Uppume.
... ... he saw the ramp that I had constructed against him and (he), the one who had given (himself) the unfortunate advice, who had endangered his (own) life, who had turned to his ... ..., who caused the destruction of his inhabited settlements, and ... and who had dissipated (his) well-organized army, he made a statue of ... and clothed (it) with sackcloth. He placed it in ... fetters, as befitted slavery, (ii 20) made it hold a grindstone for milling in its .... (Like) a replica of skin, he applied a skin of red gold ... and placed (the statue) in the hands of Šēr-... (and) ... gi-Teššup, his sons, and sent (it) out before me to (make me) have pity (on him and) to save his life.
Thus they said to me: “Put the ... ... crimes (and) disobedience on the asakku-demon. Let me come to sing your praises. Let me alone ... ... all of the arrogant enemies. Let the unsubmissive ...... (and) let the disrespectful honor your lordship.”
Thus I wrote him (the king of Šubria), (saying): “These ... before an offering. Like an idiot ... ... you bathe after your offerings! Like ... ... ... you put in drain pipes after the rain! Thus... the highest divine orders have been spoken twice. Your days have elapsed! Your ... has arrived! Your appointed time is here! Let ... be.... At the command of the gods of heaven (and) netherworld ... ... came forth for the destruction of your land. (ii 35) ... ... the carrying off of your people was decreed. ... ... is firmly fixed and its place cannot be changed. ... who appeases the heart of the god ..., ... ... did not turn back... ... their utterances.” ... I did not say ‘ Aḫulap! ’ to him ... my angry mood
... ... ... ... ... he plundered it ... they brought ... before me.
I carried off to Assyria ..., which was more numerous than locusts, ... from the midst of the land Šubria. I gave ... ... as a gift to the gods Aššur, Mullissu, Šerua, ..., Ninurta, Gula, Nergal, Ištar of Nineveh, Ištar of Arbela, (and) Nusku, ... who march at my side and kill my enemies, ... ... of my ..., who allow me attain everything I want.
I examined (and) selected ... ... ..., soldiers, skilled in battle and combat, (iii 15′) from ... and I attached (them) to my royal guard. With regard to ... ..., a group of charioteers, a group of cavalry, commanders of ..., officials, engineers, troops, light troops, shield bearers, scouts, farmers, shepherds, (and) orchard keepers — I added (them) in great numbers to the massive forces of the god Aššur and to the guard of the former kings, my ancestors, and I filled Assyria in its entirety like a quiver. I distributed the rest of them like sheep and goats among my palaces, my nobles, the entourage of my palace, and the citizens of Nineveh, Calah, Kalzu, (and) Arbela.
(As for) all of the runaway fugitives who had abandoned their owners and fled to the land Šubria, ... ... I cut off their hands (and) removed their noses, eyes, (and) ears. (iii 25′) (As for) ... who had not run away to another country, I punished (them). I returned every ... ... to their (text: “his”) land and to their owners. ... and they celebrated, rejoiced (and) blessed my kingship.
... ... concerning the Urarṭians who had fled from Urarṭu to the land Šubria and about whom Ursa, king of Urarṭu, wrote, he (the king of Šubria) did not listen to his command, (iii 30′) did not agree to give (them back), wrote to him (Ursa) in anger, and replied with hostility. After I captured the land Šubria with the help of the god Aššur, my lord, and counted his people as booty, in order to keep the treaty and because of the truth and justice the great gods gave to me, I inquired, questioned, investigated, (and) denounced those people. I did not hold back a single Urarṭian fugitive (and) not one escaped. I returned them to their land.
I put out to fine pasture sheep and goats, oxen, (and) cattle destined for offerings to my lords and for the royal table in Assyria.
very good (and) beautiful .... Those cities which I, demolished, destroyed, burned with fire, ... through the strength of the god Aššur, my lord, I returned by the command of the god Aššur, my lord, and ... ... I built (and) completed those cities from their foundations to their parapets.
I changed the former names of the cities Kulimmeri, Markuḫa, Kalzu, ... ... and called them by new names. I settled the people plundered by my bow from the Upper Sea (to the) Lower (Sea) in (them). I divided that land, in its entirety, in two and placed two of my officials over them as governors.
I am sending the best report to the god Aššur, my lord, by so-and-so. One charioteer, two cavalrymen, (and) three scouts are dead.

I divided that land in two, and placed two of my officials over them. I placed Bi-ilu in the city Uppume and Bēl-iddina in the city Kullimmeri. I restored ... to Assyrian territory. I imposed the tribute and payment of my lordship upon them.
In my tenth campaign, the god Aššur ... had me take ... (and) made me set out to Magan and Meluḫḫa, which are called Kush and Egypt in (their) native tongue. I mustered the vast troops of the god Aššur, who are in.... (10′) In Nisannu (I), the first month, I set out from my city, Aššur, (and) crossed the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers when they were at flood level, (and) marched over difficult mountains like a wild bull.
In the course of my campaign, I set up fortifications against Baʾalu, the king of Tyre, who trusted in his friend Taharqa, the king of Kush, threw off the yoke of the god Aššur, my lord, and kept answering (me) with insolence. I cut off the supply of food and water that sustained their lives. (15′) I removed my camp from (this so-called) ‘Egypt’ and headed straight for Meluḫḫa, (covering) a distance of thirty leagues from the city Aphek, which is in the region of Samaria, to the city Raphia, which is in the neighborhood of the Brook of Egypt, a place that has no river(s). By means of ropes, chains, (and) sweeps, I provided water for (my) troops drawn from wells.
In accordance with the command of the god Aššur, my lord, it occurred to me and my heart prompted me (and thus) I collected camels from all of the Arab kings and loaded them with water skins (and) water containers.

the king, during whose reign, the great gods became reconciled towards the shrines of their cult centers (and) returned; the sun of all of the people, the pleasant protection, trusted shepherd, herdsman of the black-headed people, (35) eternal royal seed, precious offspring of Baltil (Aššur), the one required by Ešarra, whose hands are pure, the purification priest who purifies the statues of the great gods; the one who (re)constructed the temple of the god Aššur, (re)built Esagil and Babylon, returned the plundered gods of the lands to their (proper) place, and made (them) dwell on (their) eternal daises in the shrines of all of the cult centers; who clothed (them) daily in silver (and) gold, (and) (re)confirmed the sattukku (and) ginû offerings in them; the one who completed the rites, (re)confirmed sattukku offerings, (and) gave gifts, great food offerings to all of the temples; (40) ... who does not fail to make offerings (and) fulfill rites; who observes the days of the god (and) the eššēšu-festival; the one who arranged the privileged status of Baltil (Aššur) (and) established freedom for Nippur, Babylon, Borsippa, (and) Sippar; ... all of the people who live in them; the one who repaid their losses; who gathered the scattered people of Babylon (and) (re)settled (them) in peaceful dwellings;

At the beginning of my kingship, in my first year, when the god Aššur, king of the gods, kindly placed me on the throne of my father, the god Anu granted me his crown, the god Enlil his throne, the god Ninurta his weapon, (and) the god Nergal his awesome splendor, good signs were established for me in heaven and on earth concerning the refurbishing of the gods and the (re)building of shrines.
Jupiter shone brightly and came near in Simānu (III) and stood in the place where the sun shines. It reached (its) hypsoma for a second time in the month “Opening of the Door” and stayed in its place.
In order to triumph (and) to show overpowering strength, he (the god Marduk) revealed to me good omen(s) concerning the (re-)entering of Esagil. The stars of heaven stood in their positions and took the correct path (and) left the incorrect path. Every month, the gods Sîn and Šamaš together, (60) at their appearance, answered me with a firm ‘yes’ concerning the renewing of the gods, the completion of the shrines of cult centers, the lasting stability of my reign, (and) the securing of the throne of my priestly office.
At that time, I, Esarhaddon, king of the world, king of Assyria, the one selected (and) chosen by the god Aššur, the one required by the great gods, with the broad wisdom (and) vast comprehension that the sage of the gods, the prince, the god Nudimmud (Ea), gave to me, (and) through the great wisdom that the gods Aššur and Marduk imparted to me (lit. “opened my ears”) for refurbishing the great gods, (65) I prayed to the divinity of the god Aššur, king of the gods, and the great lord, the god Marduk, with raised hands, prayers, and expressions of humility, (saying):
“With whom, O great gods, will you continually send me to create gods and goddesses, difficult work (performed) in an inaccessible place? (Can I undertake) the renovation work with people who are deaf (and) blind, who do not know themselves (and) whose future is (still) undecided? The creation of gods and goddesses is in your hands, so build yourselves a cella for your majestic divinity! Whatever is in your heart, let it be done! Through the unalterable (words) spoken by your lips, (70) give the skilled craftsmen, whom you ordered to perform this work, sublime knowledge like the god Ea, their creator, and teach them the skills (needed). By your exalted command, let them make all of their handiwork succeed (while doing) the work of the god Ninšiku.”
I kneeled reverently (seeking) the judgment of the gods Šamaš and Adad, and I stationed diviners to (ascertain) their true decisions. I had an extispicy performed concerning (the selection of the) use of the workshop in Baltil (Aššur), Babylon, or Nineveh, and I placed (before the diviners) separate lists of craftsmen who should do the work and be allowed to enter the secret place. (75) The omens were unanimous: they answered me with a firm ‘yes,’ (and) told me (it should be) in Baltil (Aššur), (my) dynastic city, the residence of the father of the gods, the god Aššur. They indicated to me the workshop to use (and) the craftsmen to perform the work. Through truthful, trustworthy portents, diviners told me to perform that work, (saying) thus: “Do (it) quickly, pay attention, (and) be careful! Do not procrastinate! You should not turn your attention to anything else!” I trusted their immutable, firm ‘yes,’ and I felt confident.
In a favorable month, on a propitious day, in Šabāṭu (XI), the favorite month of the god Enlil, (exactly) as they (the gods) wished, I entered the workshop where the renovations (would be done) and I brought carpenters, jewelers, copper smiths, seal cutters, skilled craftsmen, who know the secrets, into the temple that the gods Šamaš and Adad had selected by divination, (and) I installed them (there).
(As for) red gold, an ore from its mountain which nobody had (yet) cast into a work of art, (and) countless precious stones, that have not (yet) seen (the light of) day, the creation of the mountains where the god Ea greatly decreed their fate to be the radiance for the artwork of lordship, I had (them) greatly prepared and delivered to their (the craftsmen’s) pure hands for the shrines of the great gods, my lords, and for the ornamentation of their divinity. I had an artfully (designed) crown, which is befitting the lordship (85) of the god Aššur, king of the gods, my lord, made of red gold and precious stones, and I restored it. The god Aššur, the great lord, accepted magnanimously that crown, (which is) clothed in splendorous radiance, full of dignity, radiating a glow, (and) wrapped in brilliance, and his spirit was pleased (and) his countenance shone.
The gods Bēl, Bēltīya, Bēlet-Bābili, Ea, (and) Mandānu, the great gods, were truly created in Ešarra, the temple of their progenitor, and they grew beautiful in figure. I sumptuously adorned their features with red ṣāriru-gold, the creation of Mount Arallu (and) an ore from its mountain. I adorned their necks and covered their chests with magnificent ornaments (and) precious jewelry, all that the great lord, the god Marduk, had in mind (and) that the queen, the goddess Zarpanītu, wanted. They fashioned images of their great divinity more artfully than before (and) greatly adorned them. They provided (them) with awe-inspiring vigor (and) made (them) shine like the sun.
I made anew a seat of everlasting musukkannu-wood together with a footstool, covered with red gold, for the goddess Tašmētu, the great lady, who lives in Eumuša, the cella of the god Marduk, which is in Babylon. I refurbished the god Amurru, the one who cleanses heaven and netherworld, the one who purifies Esagil, (and) who lives in Enamtaggadua. I renewed the gods Abšušu (and) Abtagigi, who live in Egišḫurankia, the temple of the divine lady of Nineveh, and all of the gods (and) goddesses (that) the gods Aššur and Marduk ordered (me to), and I returned (them) to their (proper) places: I returned the gods Great-Anu, Šarrat-Dēri, Niraḫ, Bēlet-balāṭi, Kurunītum, Sakkud of the city Bubê, (and) Mār-bīti to Dēr, their city; (95) I returned the goddess Uṣur-amāssa, the one who gives counsel, the intercessor, to Uruk, her city; (and) I returned the god Šamaš of Larsa to Larsa (and) the gods Ḫumḫumiya, Šuqamuna, (and) Šimaliya to Sippar-Aruru.
I mustered all of my workmen from Karduniaš (Babylonia) in its entirety, and I made them to take up hoe (and) basket. I had (them) make bricks in brickmolds of ivory, ebony, boxwood, (and) musukkannu-wood. I mixed mortar with fine oil, honey, ghee, kurunnu-wine, muttinnu-wine, (and) mountain beer.
In a favorable month, (on) a propitious day, in the same manner, I laid the foundations of Eḫursaggalkurkura — the bond of heaven and netherworld, the residence of (the god) Aššur, the king of the gods, my lord — and Esagil — the palace of the gods, the dwelling of the great divine lord, the god Marduk — (and) Babylon — the city of the residence of his divinity — on gold, silver, desirable aromatics, honey, ghee, wine, kurunnu-wine, (and) ... (and)I secured their brickwork.

I placed at their service ramku-priests, pašīšu-priests, ecstatics, those initiated in secret rites, purification priests, āšipu-priests, lamentation priests, (and) singers, who have mastered (their) entire craft.

they (the gods) named me for shepherding the land and people.
In order to give the land and the people verdicts of truth and justice, the gods Sîn and Šamaš, the twin gods, took the road of truth and justice monthly.
They made (their simultaneous) appearance regularly on days... and fourteen. Venus, the brightest of the stars, was seen in the west, (ii 1) in the Path of the Ea-stars. Concerning the securing of the land (and) the reconciliation of its gods, it (Venus) (ii 5) reached (its) hypsoma and then disappeared. Mars, the giver of decisions on the land Amurru, shone brightly in the Path of the Ea-stars (and) it revealed its sign (ii 10) concerning the strengthening of the ruler and his land. Messages from ecstatics were constantly available.
Good signs occurred for me concerning the securing of the foundation of the throne of my priestly office forever. Favorable omens concerning (ii 20) the securing of my throne (and) the prolongation of my reign came to me in dreams and through oracles. I saw those (signs), was encouraged, and my mood felt good.
(As for) Baltil (Aššur), the foremost cult city, whose privileged status had been established with (that of) the people of Anu (and) Enlil from early days and (ii 35) whose kanakku-status ... — I, Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, love the inhabitants of Baltil (Aššur) (ii 40) like my own precious life (and thus) it occurred to me and my heart prompted me to greatly increase their freedom more than before.
I wrote anew the tablet of their exemptions. I made (them) larger (and) bigger than before; I raised (them) up (and) glorified (them). I exempted them from barley taxes (and) straw taxes, and from the dues (levied) on the quays (and) crossing points throughout my land. I established the remission of their debts (and) set up divine protection in their gates forever.
The former temple of the god Aššur, which Ušpia, my ancestor, priest of the god Aššur, first built, became dilapidated and Erišum (I), son of Ilu-šūma, my ancestor, priest of the god Aššur, (re)built (it); one hundred and twenty-six years passed and it became dilapidated again, and Šamšī-Adad (I), (iii 25) son of Ilā-kabkabī, my ancestor, priest of the god Aššur, (re)built (it); four hundred and thirty-four years passed and that temple was destroyed in a conflagration, (and) Shalmaneser (I), son of Adad-nārārī (I), my ancestor, priest of the god Aššur, (re)built (it); five hundred and eighty years passed and (iii 35) the inner cella, the residence of the god Aššur, my lord, the bīt-šaḫūru, the temple of the god Kubu, the temple of the god Dibar, (and) the temple of the god Ea became dilapidated, aged, (and) antique.
I was worried, afraid, (and) hesitant about renovating that temple. In the diviner’s bowl, (iv 1) the gods Šamaš and Adad answered me with a firm ‘yes’ and they had (their response) concerning the (re)building of that temple (and) the renovation of its chapel written on a liver.
I, Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, reverent king, pious prince, (iv 10) favorite of the great gods, gathered the people conquered by me (and) made (them) take up hoe and basket. I razed that temple from its battlements to its foundations (and) mixed (the mud for) its revetment with oil, honey, (iv 20) ghee, wine, (and) cedar resin. They made bricks in brickmolds of ivory, boxwood, ebony, musukkannu-wood, cedar, (and) cypress.
I, the pious slave who reveres him, put on an apron (and) made bricks with my (own) pure hands. (iv 35) I let the people of the lands see the might of the god Aššur, my lord. I raised a basket on my head and carried (it) by myself. (iv 40) I showed (it) to the people in order to inspire awe (in) the lands. The people of the lands, the brick makers, made bricks for one year in happiness, joy, and rejoicing.
In a favorable month, on a propitious day, I laid its foundations (v 10) with limestone, a strong mountain stone, over gold, silver, stones, antimony, all kinds of aromatics, pūru-oil, fine oil, honey, ghee, beer, (and) wine, (and) laid (them) on bedrock. (v 15) I made foundation documents (bearing) inscriptions written in my name and placed (them) in it. I mixed its mortar with oil, fine oil, (v 20) pūru-oil, honey, ghee, (and) cedar resin. For the preservation of my life and the lengthening of my days, I carried (v 25) the first brick on my neck and (then) laid its foundations (and) secured its brickwork.
When the second year arrived, I raised the top of Ešarra, the residence of the god Aššur, my lord, to the sky. (v 35) Above, I made it tower to the heavens, (and) below, I secured its foundations in the netherworld. I made Eḫursaggula, (v 40) the temple of the great mountain, glisten like the stars (lit. “writing”) of the firmament. I heaped (it) up like a mountain.
I built (and) completed that temple from its foundations to its parapets (and) filled (it) with splendor to be seen. (vi 10) I roofed it with beams of cedar (and) cypress, grown on Mount Sirāra (and) Mount Lebanon, whose fragrance is sweet. I fastened bands of gold on doors of cypress and installed (them) in its gates.
I restored the shrines, daises, cult platforms, (and) ruined ground plans; I made (them) good and made (them) shine (vi 20) like the sun. Its top was high (and) reached the heavens; below, its foundations were entwined with the apsû. I made anew whatever furnishings (vi 25) were needed for Ešarra and put (them) in it.
I had the god Aššur, king of the gods, dwell in his lordly, sublime chapel on (his) eternal dais (and) I placed the gods Ninurta, Nusku, (and all of) the gods (and) goddesses in their stations (vi 35) to the right and left. I slaughtered a fattened bull (and) butchered sheep; I killed birds of the heavens and fish from the apsû, (vii 1) without number; (and) I piled up before them the harvest of the sea (and) the abundance of the mountains. The burning of incense, (vii 5) a fragrance of sweet resin, covered the wide heavens like heavy fog. I presented them with gifts from the inhabited settlements, (vii 10) (their) heavy audience gift(s), and I gave (them) gifts. I banned access to A.RI.A.TA.BAR, (that is) ‘Foreign Seed,’ from its midst and appeased his (Aššur’s) anger.
The god Aššur, king of the gods, truly looked on my good deeds and (vii 20) his heart became joyful, his mood shone. He blessed me with a blessing of long days and (vii 25) named me as the builder of the temple. I, together with my nobles (and) the people of my land, (vii 30) held a celebration in the courtyard of Ešarra for three days. I appeased the heart of his great divinity and placated his mood.
I made foundation inscriptions, wrote the deeds that I had done on them, and left (them) forever for future kings, my descendants.
May one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur names to rule over the land and people, read my foundation inscription, (viii 10) anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Aššur will (then) hear his prayers.
(As for) the one who alters
May the god Aššur, king of the gods, look upon him with fury, overthrow his kingship, make his name (and) his seed disappear from the land, (and) have no pity on him.

I built (it) for my life, the prolongation of my days, the securing of my reign, the well-being of my seed, the safeguarding of the throne of my priestly office, the overthrowing of my enemies, the prospering of the harvest of Assyria, (and) the well-being of Assyria.

I built (it) for my life, the prolongation of my days, the securing of my reign, the well-being of my seed, the safeguarding of the throne of my priestly office, the overthrowing of my enemies, the prospering of the harvest of Assyria, (and) the well-being of Assyria.
Moreover, I struck with the sword Teušpa, a Cimmerian; I conquered Sidon, caught its king like a fish, and cut off his head; I conquered the Brook of Egypt, threw Asuḫīli, its king, into fetters and took him to Assyria; I conquered the city Bāsu (Bāzu), a district in a remote place; I fixed the tribute of my lordship on Qanâ, king of Dilmun;
I conquered the land Šubria to its full extent; I killed with the sword Ik-Teššup, its king, who would not listen to the words of my command; I conquered Tyre, which is in the midst of the sea, (and) took away all of the cities (and) possessions of Baʾalu, its king, who had trusted in Taharqa, king of Kush; (and) I conquered (Lower) Egypt, Upper Egypt, and Kush, struck Taharqa, its king, five times with arrows, and ruled his entire land.
I wrote to all of the kings who are in the midst of the sea, from Iadnana (Cyprus) (and) Ionia to Tarsus, (and) they bowed down at my feet. I received their heavy tribute. I achieved victory over the rulers of the four quarters and I sprinkled the venom of death over all of (my) enemies. I carried off gold, silver, goods, possessions, people — young (and) old — horses, oxen, (and) sheep and goats, their heavy booty that was beyond counting, to Assyria.
I placed kings, governors, officials, (and) harbormasters over their lands, and I imposed the yoke of the god Aššur, my lord, upon them. I confirmed sattukku (and) ginû offerings for the god Aššur and the great gods, my lords, forever. I imposed upon them, yearly, without ceasing, the tribute (and) payment of my lordship (and) they (now) pull my yoke.
At that time, the former temple of the god Aššur that Shalmaneser (I), son of Adad-nārārī (I), son of Arik-dēn-ili, my ancestor, had built earlier, became dilapidated (and) old. I razed that temple (and) (20′) reached its foundation pit. I laid its foundations with limestone, a strong mountain stone, (making it) like bedrock. I built (and) completed (it) from its foundation to its parapets. I roofed it with magnificent cedar beams, grown on Mount Sirāra, which I had cut down in the course of a campaign of mine.
I fastened bands of gold on doors of cypress, whose fragrance is sweet, and installed (them) in its gates. I overlaid the cella of the god Aššur, my lord, with gold (and) set up side by side laḫmu-monsters (and) kurību-genii (made) of red ṣāriru-gold. I set up golden statues of creatures from the apsû on the right and left of the chapel of the god Aššur, my lord, (and) I covered (its) walls with gold as if (it were) plaster.
The dais of destiny, the lofty dais on which the god Aššur lives (and) where they (the gods) decree the destiny of heaven and netherworld, which the kings, my ancestors, had made of baked bricks and covered with silver (zaḫalû), I (now) had (it) skillfully made of 180 talents of cast ešmarû-silver. I fashioned on it (the dais) my royal image (shown) praying to their divinity (and) imploring (them) constantly to give me life, and an image of Ashurbanipal, my crown prince.
I cast from shining bronze two bison positioned opposite each other, (with) their faces looking forward and backward, to bear (the columns which support) crossbeams (forming) the cornice in (its) gate and I set (them) up in the Gate of the Path of the Enlil-Stars. I had two fierce Deluge monsters made with skillful craftsmanship and I placed (them) in the Royal Gate, to the right and left of the gate. I (also) set up twin Deluge monsters cast of shining silver (zaḫalû) ... in the Kamsu-Igīgū Gate.
In that (same) year, I built anew Esagil, the palace of the gods, Imgur-Enlil, its (Babylon’s) wall, (and) Nēmed-Enlil, its (Babylon’s) outer wall, from their (text: “its”) foundations to their (text: “its”) battlements, and made (them) much bigger than before.
The god Bēl and the goddess Bēltīya, the divine lovers, were created in the city Aššur by their own command and were truly born in Eḫursaggalkurkura. The gods Bēlet-Bābili, Ea, (and) Mandānu were made in the city Aššur, place of the creation of gods, and I completed their figures. I sumptuously adorned their feature(s) with fifty talents of red ṣāriru-gold, the creation of Mount Arallu (and) an ore from its mountain that had not been refined. I adorned their necks (and) covered their chests with magnificent adornments (and) precious jewelry that greatly befitted their lordship.
They moved forward and went out from Eḫursaggalkurkura radiantly, like the sun to the land. They took the road to Šuanna (Babylon), a joyful path. From Baltil (Aššur) to the quay of Babylon, (piles) of brushwood were lit every third of a league (and) they slew (45′) fattened bulls at each league. Moreover, I, Esarhaddon, took the hand of his great divinity and ... before him. I had them joyfully enter into Babylon, their home city.
They (the gods) entered the orchards, groves, canals, (and) gardens of Ekarzagina, a pure place (where) the craft of the sage, “the washing of the mouth,” “the opening of the mouth,” “bathing,” (and) “purification” (were recited) before the stars of heaven: the gods Ea, Šamaš, Asalluḫi, Bēlet-ilī, Kusu, Ningirima, Ninkurra, Ninagal, Kusibanda, Ninildu, (and) Ninzadim. ... ... ...

The king, who with the help of the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Nabû, Marduk, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, marched freely from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea and made all of his enemies and the rulers who were unsubmissive to him bow down at his feet; (15) the one who conquered the city Sidon, which is in the midst of the sea, (and) the one who leveled all of its dwellings; the one who plundered the city Arzâ, which is in the neighborhood of the Brook of Egypt, (and) who threw Asuḫīli, its king, into fetters along with his counselors (and) brought (them) to Assyria; moreover, (I am) the one who struck with the sword Teušpa, a Cimmerian, together with his entire army, in the territory of the land Ḫubušna; the one who treads on the unsubmissive people of Cilicia;

As for me, Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, pious prince, to whom the prince, the god Ninšiku (Ea), gave (wisdom) equal to that of the sage Adapa, that terrace was on my mind and I (text: “he”) thought about it. I incorporated unused land as an addition (and) raised the terrace with massive stone blocks from the mountains.

The palace of Esarhaddon, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, son of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, descendant of Sargon (II), king of Assyria.
Palace of Esarhaddon, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria.
Property of Esarhaddon, king of the world, king of Assyria, son of Sennacherib, king of the world (and) king of Assyria, which was placed in the midst of the platform, more or less.
Esarhaddon, great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, the true shepherd who reorganized the confused people and made light shine forth for them; to whom the great gods gave as a gift (the ability) to create, build, (and) renew; the one who (re)constructed the temple of the god Aššur, (re)built Esagil and Babylon, completed all of the cult centers, renewed the statues of the great gods, (and) who returned the plundered gods of the lands to their (proper) place from Assyria; who plated Egašankalama, the temple of the goddess Ištar of Arbela, his lady, with silver (zaḫalû) and made (it) shine like daylight — I had lions, screaming anzû-birds, laḫmu-monsters, (and) kurību-genii fashioned from silver and copper and set (them) up in its entry doors.
The king, who with the help of the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Nabû, Marduk, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, marched freely from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea and made all of his enemies and the rulers who were unsubmissive to him bow down at his feet; the one who conquered the city Sidon, which is in the midst of the sea, (and) the one who leveled all of its dwellings; the one who plundered the city Arzâ, which is in the neighborhood of the Brook of Egypt, (and) who threw Asuḫīli, its king, into fetters along with his counselors (and) brought (them) to Assyria; moreover, (I am) the one who struck with the sword Teušpa, a Cimmerian, together with his entire army, in the territory of the land Ḫubušna; the one who treads on the unsubmissive people of Cilicia;
the one who drove out Nabû-zēr-kitti-līšir, son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan); the one who sacked Bīt-Dakkūri, which is in Chaldea, an enemy of Babylon; the one who captured Šamaš-ibni, its king, a rogue (and) outlaw — I surrounded, captured, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire the cities Ḫandasu, Magalani, Alpiana, Diḫrāni, Qatabuʾ, Padê, (and) Udēru, fortified cities in the district of the land Bāzu, together with small cities in their environs.
The one who crushed the Barnaki, a dangerous enemy, who live in the land Tīl-Ašurri, which is called Pitānu in the language of the people of the land Miḫrānu; the one who scattered the Mannean people, undisciplined Gutians — (as for) the land Patušarri, a district in the area of the salt desert, which is in the midst of the land of the distant Medes, borders Mount Bikni, (and) upon the soil of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had walked, I carried off to Assyria Šidir-parna (and) E-parna, mighty chieftains, who were not submissive to (my) yoke, together with their people (and) their heavy plunder.
Son of Sennacherib, king of the world (and) king of Assyria, descendant of Sargon (II), king of the world, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad —
At that time the site of the small palace, which is in the city Tarbiṣu, had become too small. I added more land as an addition (making it) bigger than before and I completely raised (its) terrace. I built (and) completed a magnificent palace, whose site is very extensive, (25) for the pleasure of Ashurbanipal — senior son of the king, who (resides in) the House of Succession, my beloved son, whom the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, Nabû, Nergal, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela called to exercise kingship — from its foundations to its parapets. I roofed them with magnificent cedar beams, grown on Mount Amanus, (and) installed doors of cypress, whose fragrance is sweet, in their gates. I filled (it) with splendor (making it) an object of wonder for all of the people.
I had a foundation inscription written in my name and written in the name of Ashurbanipal, the senior son of the king, who (resides in) the House of Succession, my beloved son, and placed (this inscription) in it.
After I finished the work on that palace and completed its construction, I invited the god Nergal (and) the goddess Laṣ, (gods) who live in the city Tarbiṣu, into it. I made large, pure offerings before them (and) presented (them) with my gifts.
May the god Nergal (and) the goddess Laṣ decree for me a blessing of long days (and) years of good health (and) happiness, and may they give (the same) to Ashurbanipal, my beloved son, as a gift.
May a future ruler, one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar name to rule the people, renovate the dilapidated section(s) of that palace when it becomes old and dilapidated. May he read a foundation inscription written in my name and written in the name of Ashurbanipal, the senior son of the king, who (resides in) the House of Succession, my beloved son, and may he anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) place (it) with a foundation inscription written in his name. The god Nergal (and) the goddess Laṣ will (then) hear his prayers.
Ayyāru (II), eighteenth day, eponymy of Nabû-bēlī-uṣur, governor of (the city) Dūr-Šarrukku (672 BC), when the treaty concerning Ashurbanipal, the senior son of the king, who (resides in) the House of Succession, was made.
I, Esarhaddon, great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, built (and) completed a palace in the city Tarbiṣu as the residence of Ashurbanipal.
I, Esarhaddon, great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the kings of (Lower) Egypt, (5) Upper Egypt, (and) Kush built (and) completed a palace in the city Tarbiṣu as the residence of Ashurbanipal, the senior son of the king, who (resides in) the House of Succession, my offspring.
Esarhaddon, king of the world, king of Assyria, had a palace built anew in the city Tarbiṣu from its foundations to its parapets.

... Hazael, the king of the Arabs, who came to Nineveh, my capital city, with his heavy audience gift and kissed my feet, implored me to give (back) his gods, and (10) I had pity on him.

The god Aššur, father of the gods, who loves my priestly service; the god Anu, the powerful, the foremost, the one who called my name; the god Enlil, lofty lord, the one confirmed my reign; the god Ea, wise one, knowing one, who decrees my destiny; (5) the god Sîn, shining Nannar, the one who makes signs favorable for me; the god Šamaš, judge of heaven and netherworld, the one who provides decisions for me; the god Adad, terrifying lord, the one who makes my troops prosper; the god Marduk, hero of the Igīgū and Anunnakū gods, the one who makes my kingship great; the goddess Ištar, lady of war and battle, who goes at my side; the Sebitti, valiant gods, the ones who overthrow my enemies; (and) the great gods, all of them, who decree destiny (and) give victorious might to the king, their favorite,
Esarhaddon, great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer (15) and Akkad, king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), (king of) all of them; king of the kings of (Lower) Egypt, Upper Egypt, and Kush; the one who reveres the great gods, majestic dragon; beloved of the gods Aššur, Šamaš, Nabû, and Marduk; king of kings, (20) the merciless, the one who curbs the insolent ones, the one who is clothed in splendor, fearless in battle, perfect warrior, merciless in combat, almighty prince, the one who holds the nose-rope of rulers, raging lion, (25) avenger of (his) father, who engendered him; the king, who with the help of the gods Aššur, Šamaš, Nabû, and Marduk, the gods, his helpers, marched freely and (30) attained his wish — he broke all of those disobedient to him (and) rulers unsubmissive to him like a reed in the swamp and trampled (them) underfoot.
The one who provides provisions for the great gods, knows how to revere the gods and goddesses, (rev. 1) ... ...; the one who (re)constructed the temple of the god Aššur, completed its ornaments, (re)built Esagil and Babylon, restored the rites, (and) who returned the plundered gods of the lands (rev. 5) to their (proper) place from the city Aššur; the king whose food offerings the great gods love and whose priestly service they established forever in the temples;
to whose lordship they gave their merciless weapons as a gift; the king, whom the lord of lords, the god Marduk, made greater than the kings of the four quarters, (rev. 10) whose lordship he made the greatest; the one who made the lands, all of them, bow down at his feet (and) who imposed tribute and payment on them; the one who conquered his enemies (and) destroyed his foes; the king whose passage is the deluge and whose deeds are a raging lion — before he (comes) it is a city, when he leaves it is a tell. The assault of his fierce battle is a blazing flame, a restless fire.
Son of Sennacherib, king of the world (and) king of Assyria; descendant of Sargon (II), king of the world, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad; royal descendant of the eternal line of Bēl-bāni, son of Adasi, founder of the kingship of Assyria, whose place of ultimate origin is Baltil (Aššur) —
By the command of the gods Aššur, Šamaš, Nabû, and Marduk, the great gods, lordship fell to me. I am mighty, I am almighty, I am lordly, I am proud, I am strong, (rev. 20) I am important, I am glorious, (and) I have no equal among all of the kings. Chosen by the gods Aššur, Nabû, and Marduk; called by the god Sîn, favorite of the god Anu, beloved of the queen — the goddess Ištar, goddess of everything — (and) the merciless weapon that makes the enemy land tremble, am I. A king, expert in battle and war, the one who slaughters the settlements of his enemies, the one who kills his foes, the one who dissolves his adversaries, the one who makes the unsubmissive bow down, (and) the one who rules over all of the people of the world —
The gods Aššur, Šamaš, Nabû, and Marduk, my lofty lords, whose word cannot be changed, decreed as my destiny an unrivaled kingship. The goddess Ištar, the lady who loves my priestly service, put in my hands a strong bow (and) a mighty arrow, the slayer of the disobedient; she allowed me to achieve my wish and made all of the unsubmissive kings bow down at my feet.
When the god Aššur, the great lord, (wanted) to reveal the glorious might of my deeds to the people, he made my kingship the most glorious and made my name greatest of the kings of the four quarters, made my hands carry a terrible staff to strike the enemy, (and) empowered me to loot (and) plunder (any) land (that) had committed sin, crime, (or) negligence against the god Aššur (rev. 35) (and) to enlarge the territory of Assyria. After the god Aššur and the great gods, my lords, had ordered me to march far along remote roads, (through) rugged mountains (and) great sand dunes, where (one is always) thirsty, I marched safely (and) in good spirits.
As for Taharqa, the king of Egypt and Kush, the accursed of their great divinity, from the city Išḫupri to Memphis, (his) royal city, a march of fifteen days overland, (rev. 40) I inflicted serious defeats on him daily, without ceasing. Moreover, (with regard to) he himself, by means of arrows, I inflicted him five times with wounds from which there is no recovery; and (as for) the city of Memphis, his royal city, within half a day (and) by means of mines, breaches, (and) ladders, I besieged (it), conquered (it), demolished (it), destroyed (it), (and) burned (it) with fire.
I carried off to Assyria his wife, his court ladies, Ušanaḫuru, his crown prince, and the rest of his sons (and) his daughters, his goods, his possessions, his horses, his oxen, (rev. 45) (and) his sheep and goats, without number. I tore out the roots of Kush from Egypt. I did not leave a single person there to praise (me). Over Egypt, all of it, I appointed anew kings, governors, commanders, customs officers, trustees, (and) overseers. I confirmed sattukku (and) ginû offerings for the god Aššur and the great gods, my lords, forever. I imposed the tribute and payment of my lordship on them, yearly, without ceasing.
I had a stele written in my name made and I had inscribed upon it the renown (and) heroism of the god Aššur, my lord, (and) the might of my deeds which I had done with the help of the god Aššur, my lord, and my victory (and) triumph. I set (it) up for all time for the admiration of all of (my) enemies.
Whoever takes away this stele from its place and erases my inscribed name and writes his name, covers (it) with dirt, throws (it) into water, burns (it) with fire, or puts (it) in a place where (it) cannot be seen, may the goddess Ištar, lady of war and battle, change him from a man into a woman, and may she seat him, bound, at the feet of his enemy. May a future ruler look upon a stele written in my name, read (it) aloud (while standing) in front of it, anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) praise the name of the god Aššur, my lord.

Esarhaddon, great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), governor of Babylon, king of the land of Sumer and Akkad, selected by the steadfast heart of the god Enlil; who from his childhood trusted in the gods Aššur, Enlil, Sîn, Šamaš, Adad, Marduk, Nabû, Nergal, and the (other) great gods, (10) his lords, (who) allowed him to attain his desire; (the one who) recognized their power, (the one) over whom (the gods) extended their eternal protection in order to appease their divine heart(s) and set their mind(s) at rest; (the one who) by the might of the gods Aššur, Enlil, Bēl (Marduk), and the Son-of-Bēl (Nabû), the gods, his helpers, ruled over all lands and made all rulers submissive to him; (15) the one who (re)constructed the temple of the god Aššur, renovated Ekur, (re)built Esagil and Babylon, completed the sanctuaries and cult centers, (and) (re)confirmed (their) sattukku offerings; the king during the days of whose reign the great lord, the god Marduk, became reconciled to Babylon (and again) took up his residence in Esagil, his palace; (the one who) made the god Great-Anu enter into his city Dēr and his temple Edimgalkalama (“House, Great Bond of the Land”) and (20) had (him) sit upon (his) eternal dais; (the one who) restored the splendid appearance of the plundered gods of the lands, returned them from Assyria to their (proper) places, and (re)confirmed their income; wise prince, expert who knows every craft, who constantly established appropriate procedures in the great cult centers (and) has purification rites performed correctly; (25) son of Sennacherib, king of the world (and) king of Assyria; descendant of Sargon (II), king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, (and) king of the land of Sumer and Akkad; descendant of the eternal line of Bēl-bāni, son of Adasi, king of Assyria; precious scion of Baltil (Aššur), (one of) royal lineage (and) ancient stock —
At that time, Ekur (“House, Mountain”), the temple of the god Enlil, lord of the lands, my lord, which a previous king had built, became old and its walls buckled. I sought its (original) emplacement, removed its dilapidated parts, (and) surveyed its (entire) foundation. I completely (re)built (it) with the work of the god Kulla according to its ancient specifications (and) raised its top (as high) as a mountain.
(On account of this), may the god Enlil, the god who helps me, look upon my works with pleasure and may a good word for me be set upon his lips! May he determine as my fate a long life, fullness of old age, good health, and happiness!
If at any time in the future, during the days of the reign of some future ruler, this temple falls into disrepair and becomes dilapidated, may (that ruler) seek out its (original) emplacement (and) repair its dilapidated parts! May he anoint an inscription written in my name with oil, make an offering, (and) set (it) back in its place! The gods will (then) hear his prayers. He will lengthen (his) days (and) enlarge (his) family.
(But as for) the one who by some crafty device destroys an inscription written in my name or changes its position, may the god Enlil (...) glare at him angrily and determine a bad fate for him! May he make his name (and) his descendant(s) disappear from the land and have no pity on him!
For the god Adad, who resides in the city Guzana, his lord: Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, son of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, made (this bucket) for his (long) life.
