The king's word to Aššur-šarru-uṣur: I am well, Assyria is well: you can be glad.
As to what you wrote to me: " A messenger of Midas the Phrygian has come to me, bringing me 14 men of Que whom Urik had sent to Urarṭu as an embassy" — this is extremely good! My gods Aššur, Šamaš, Bel and Nabû have now taken action, and without a battle or anything, the Phrygian has given us his word and become our ally!
As to what you wrote: " I shall not send my messenger to the Phrygian without the permission of the king, my lord" — I am now writing to (tell) you that you should not cut off your messenger from the Phrygian's presence. Write to him in friendly terms and constantly listen to news about him, until I have more time.
As to what you wrote: " Should I send his subjects to him just as he sent me the subjects of the king my lord?" — send them to him so that he will be favourably disposed towards us. Whether 100 men or 10, write to him like this: " I wrote to the king my lord about the men of Que whom you sent to me, and he was extremely pleased; and in return he wrote to me as follows: ' Do not hold back even a single one of the Phrygians at your court, but send them to Midas immediately!' Thus at the king my lord's behest I am (now) sending you these men."
As to what you wrote: " A messenger of Urpala'a came to me for an audience with the Phrygian messenger" — let him come, and let Aššur, Šamaš, Bel and Nabû command that all these kings should wipe your sandals with their beards!
As to what you wrote: " Kilar has requested from me four districts, saying: ' Let them give them to me'" — should you give these four districts to Kilar, would he not become your equal, and what would you yourself be ruling over as governor then? Tell him as follows: " Earlier, you were afraid of the Phrygian, but now the Phrygian has made peace with us, so what are you afraid of? Now eat your bread and drink your water under the protection of the king, my lord, and be happy. Do not worry about the Phrygian."
As to what you wrote: " Urpala'a may slip away from the king, my lord, on account of the fact that the Atunnaeans and Istuandaeans came and took the cities of Bit-Paruta away from him" — now that the Phrygian has made peace with us and ..., what can all the kings of Tabal do henceforth? You will press them from this side and the Phrygian from that side so that (in no time) you will snap your belt on them. Thanks to my gods Aššur, Šamaš, Bel and Nabû, this land has now been trodden under your feet! Move about as you please, do whatever you have to do, cut the long and lengthen the short until I come and give you ... work!
As to Balasu concerning whom you wrote, I have heard his words in full. The day you see this letter, appoint his son in his place over his men. His people should be assembled and present, and if he wants, he may take them over the mountains and settle them there, or they may also live here. As for him, let one of your ' third men' pick him up post-haste and let him come here. I will speak kindly with him and encourage him, and in due course I will send word and have his people (being kept) here returned, and he too can go and re-enter his house.
As for Aplaiu, let your messenger bring him and his people to me, whether (they are) citizens of Babylon, Borsippa, Kish, Nippur, Uruk, Der, or (...)
To the king, my lord: your servant Sin-ašared. Good health to the king, my lord!

... I have just sent to the king, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant Mannu-ki-Aššur-le'i. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Make a list of all the natives of Kumme who hold houses in your district, and resettle them!" —
I have enquired and investigated (and found that) the entire ...... in the city of Zarana. I have written to every single place ...... (and found that) just along the king's road, there is one ....... It is unsuitable for passing .......
Perhaps the king, my lord, (now) says: " Why did you tarry until now?" I ... ed the area of the whole district ..., fetched the men of Kumme from Zarana and settled them in that place. Later on, I wrote (this letter). There is/are no ...... here.
As to what the king my lord wrote to me: " Give Bel-duri the land that I ordered you (to give)!" — the king, my lord, did not give me any (such) order previously, but now (that) the king my lord has written to me, I have done as it was written in the king my lord's letter and given the land.
I am herewith writing down the land Bel-duri holds in the district of Guzana and sending (the information) to the king, my lord:
60 hectares in the town of Aridu along the canal near Kubanaše; 200 in the village of Mar-jaba near Ilhini; 40 hectares in the town of ... ritu near Guzana; 200 in the village of Amdanu near Bur-šarri: in all 500 (hectares of) land that Bel-duri holds in the district of Guzana. In addition to this, I have today given (him) the 80 hectares of land about which the king my lord now wrote to me.
Ever since the eunuchs of the king my lord came, land in Guzana has been nonexistent. The fields of ......, the land that the king my lord ...... to one among the cities ....... I have no ... to give ......; from (what I have), I can parcel out and give ... to Bel-duri only. The king, my lord, should knnow this.
To the king, my lord: your servant Bel-liqbi. Good health to the kiing, my lord! The king's land and district are well.
The Arabs are settled on the other side of the Ha dina river; they come ... ... and go, everything is fine.
I have driven the farmer(s) and gardener(s) of Ammili'ti son of Amiri out of my towns and torn down a ... of sheep he had constructed. Now, he came to me saying: " Why have you expelled my subjects? I shall write to the Palace!" I proposed a bargain, saying: " Your subjects molested my subjects. But since you are the king's servant, I will give you fields and gardens in the land of Yasubuqu. Take it!" The king my lord should know this in case he writes to the king my lord.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " You have made Huzaza into a merchant town! The people have been selling iron for money to the Arabs!" — who are the merchants that have been selling there? Three men, elders of the ' Ateans, are ... there; they stock grapes, 20 or 30 homers, as much as we bring in, and sell them to the Arabs. I sell iron to the deportees only, copper to the Arabs.
By the gods of the king my lord (I swear) I am staying in Šupat! In Huzaza I have only sold 30 homers of grapes for silver. The king my lord should (only) hold me accountable for this!
A toll collector has been placed at the city-gate of Ṣupat, and now they have placed another one in Huzaza; the Arabs are leaving and not coming any more because they have become scared. Am I less loyal to the king my lord than a toll collector? And do I appropriate a shekel from my duty for doing it?
My carpenters who worked in Ṣupat ran away from me. The king, my lord, wrote that they should return to Dur-Šarruken, so I got hold of them and brought them down, but one of them got sick and died while the other ran away again.
The king my lord knows that I have been losing artisans; I would not like to relinquish them either for repair work or for making ... s. A ba tu, a chariot-maker, and Qanê, a smith, (both) servants of Bel-šarru-uṣur, came to me saying: "......
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-zer-ketti-lešir. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
As to Gidgidanu and his brothers about whom the king, my lord wrote to me, ...... the temple ...... his promise;
he has not been able to ... the king my lord's ... in the eyes of the king, my lord, and has not ......
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Why have these brothers of Gidgidanu quitted (their) work and left, going away?" —
if the brothers of Gidgidanu working with me, if even one of them has gone out of the city gate of Dur-Šarruken and gone to the south or north, may the king my lord not let me live!
When the king my lord wrote to the crown prince and he punished me, ....... These words ...... I swear no one of the brothers of Gidgidanu has gone out of Dur-Šarruken!
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-pašir. Good health to the king, my lord! May Sin and Nikkal bless the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Give 200 homers of oil in Til-Barsip to Kiṣir-Aššur, governor of Dur- Šarruken," — I set aside 200 homers of oil and delivered it.
I have now written the oil consumption and the oil remaining on a writing-board and am herewith sending it to the king, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant Ṭab-šar-Aššur. Good health to the king, my lord!
On the 17th I and Kiṣir-Aššur went to the Zab river and inspected the timber; the logs were many, as many as we could possibly desire.

Kiṣir-Aššur ... the timber, (whereas) I went to Dur-Šarruken ......
To the king, my lord: your servant Aššur-šumi-ke'in. Good health to the king, my lord! May Aššur bless the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Find big twelve-cubit bull colossi!" —
There are two in front of the main gate of the center of the city; one is an eleven-cubit colossus of the Chief Cupbearer; the other has a ... and is not ' clean'.
Then there are two bull colossi of Zeru-ibni, each ten cubits; one he has set up in front of the royal palace, the other one is extra and in his possession. Let him give it to the Palace Herald so it may be brought and set up before the royal palace.
Perhaps the king my lord now says: " Why should the Palace Herald get a bull colossus of Zeru-ibni?"
Once the water in the river gets less, any of the bull colossi which are being hewn along the river could stand ... the king's ....
If the king my lord so orders, I could bring down (the river) two bull colossi that have been finished, one in the city of ..., the other in Tastiate. Now, I have (already) brought down to Adia one bull colossus of Zeru-ibni; another one belonging to the Treasurer is in Urzuhina.
The king ..... bull colossi; they should quickly give me ....... What does the king my lord order? May he quickly send a messenger to his servant!
To the king, my lord: your servant Ṭab-šar-Aššur. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " The new boat which is coming from the Inner City — is there any (other) boat you are bringing in addition to it?" —
Six Assyrian boats have been launched on the river. I showed them to the boatmen, but they said: " We won't go near them."
Now, I am going to bring two of these boats and, going back and forth, use them to transport the stone steps and thresholds of the watchtowers, until I can make the remaining boats available.
I once committed a deadly sin, but the king, my lord, let me live. And this one — now, I suggested it to the king, the king my lord has ... ed his soul.
Until I have these boats ready, I will bear the responsibility for the stone colossi in Adia. I will ... them ... this .... and bring them over to this bank (of the river).
To the king my lord: your servant Hunnî. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May they give the king my lord a long life, peace of mind and good health, extreme old age, a strong army, a long reign and as many years as ......; may they make all countries submit themselves to you!
May the king, my lord, the good shepherd ...... truly tend and shepherd them; may Aššur, Bel and Nabû add flocks to your flocks, give them to you, and enlarge your spacious fold; may the peoples of all the countries come into your presence!
O king, my lord, may you be the temple of kings! Each and everone who lays down his life under your feet and keeps your treaty, will be pardoned in your presence by your gods, and you will dress him (in purple) and bless him as today; but whoever does not keep your treaty will fall into Aššur's noose and trap and ... the jambs of your gates.
We shall perform the ritual of which the king wrote to me tomorrow.
Within four days, ... the time (for the ritual). He (said): " (It is) time".
We shall arrive (in the Inner City) on the 1st; the ... is on the 14th; we shall spend the night in the temple on the 15th.
Now, ...... whenever the king orders.
As to the Washing-of-the-Mouth (ceremony) ......
(So) he has petitioned the king, my lord! ... Should he have turned to me, I would have handled his case! He should have come to me and not turned to the king, my lord!

This person fears the king with his lips, but with ...... the king's work falls behind schedule, and the king my lord is going to kill me because of it!
Indeed, as regards the straw and the reeds I sent ... to them ...... here ...... saw ...... they disappeared ....... Have they come to the Palace? They should ... come here! When ... who are there ......, they will return ......

"...... their ......; come with your troops and encamp in the pass of Urammu."
I am writing to you right now: this suggestion, the way he put it, is extremely good. You know that this pass leading to Urammu is very difficult to march through; there is absolutely no way the Elamite troops will be able to get at you. Don't be afraid; at the city of Urammu where you are to pitch the camp there is a plain which is very good for encamping; it is also very good for reconnaissance expeditions, there is much grass there, and it is a good place to rest.
The city of Sumurzu and ... are close by; with the help of the gods, you ......
If ...... to ..., they should kill him; they should also gather intelligence about the enemy and come and tell it to you.

As I wrote to the king, my lord, I am receiving the chariots of the magnates on the afternoon of the 16th and they are giving them over to me — the Commander-in-Chief, the Sartinnu, the Vizier, the Palace Herald, the Chief Cupbearer, the Treasurer, and the governor of Calah; in all 100 chariots capable of carrying .......
The chariots of the Chief Eunuch and the governor of Nineveh ... are missing; what does the king my lord say?
... your ..., enquire and investigate, and write down and dispatch to me the names of the soldiers killed and their sons and daughters. Perhaps there is a man who has subjugated a widow as his slave girl, or has subjugated a son or a daughter to servitude. Enquire and investigate, and bring (him/them) forth.
Perhaps there is a son who has gone into conscription in place of his father; this alone do not write down. But be sure to enquire and find out all the widows, write them down, define (their status) and send them to me.
Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, when I send my eunuch, don't say: " I brought out one widow ...... that she would die ... she would give ....."
To ..., to ....., to ....., to Remanni-... and to ...: a royal order of great urgency.
Get together your prefects plus the horses of your cavalry collection points immediately! Whoever is late will be impaled in the middle of his house,

...... let me write ...... to the king, my lord ...... who went to ..., their brothers ...... have come ......
" We shall go ......; I have ... the river ...... heavy logs ......."
I asked him: " Where are they deposited? Those which we cannot tow to ...... not to ...... the Inner City ......"?
His servants said: " From where the distant logs are being stored the river is navigable as far as the Inner City; from the Inner City to Nineveh it is difficult."
The Governor of the Land told me: " I'll first (stay) ten days here, then ...... which during ...... Labdudu ........"
On the 1st of Tishri (VII), when the earlier ... arrived in the Inner City, I asked them: " Where are the distant logs?" They said: " Opposite the city of Ariawate. The logs which we towed last year from the town of Sapirrutu in the district of the Governor opposite Zahê arrived in Nineveh in Adar (XII)."
Since I heard these words from the mouth of the Governor, that the river is navigable from Ariawate as far as the Inner City, the gods of the king willing, we shall tow the logs past the risky places and bring them to Inner City; then we shall see what lies ahead and tow them to Nineveh as best as we can.

Nabu-bel-šumati, the legate of Birat entered the Inner City on the 7th. I asked him: " Why did you come now?" He said:
" I got a royal message: ' Why is it that all (other) city-rulers have come and stood in my presence, but you have not come? Also, why is it that the Arabs plundered Sippar, but you did not go out with your servants but kept them away?'
I was scared by this message and (that is why) I came."

The stands of both bronze panthers are quite attractive; they are working on minor improvements in their finish.
As to the wood store for the iron brazier in the palace of the Inner City about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, I consulted the mayors, masons and elders (who told me this):
" The chief of public works will do the demolition and the brickwork; the sons of the palace maids will supply the materials needed and plaster its roof; if a beam is broken, the masons of the Inner City will supply the replacement."
Now, I have told the chief of public works to pull it down and buid it up, but he does not agree (but says): "..... I will supply the replacement for its broken beams."
This year may (well) pass (before the work is done); the king my lord will come in Shebat (XI) and settle (the issue).

... I transferred the beams which had been damaged to the intact ones; now, they have been counted by the Palace Herald and the Treasurer on top of the damaged ones. Perhaps the king, my lord (now) says: " Why is it that there appears to be a deficit in the figures?"

the Palace Manager petitioned the Palace in Shebat (XI), saying: " Let the ... build the palace in ......!" Now the Inner City ... ' sons of bought (slaves)' ......
In the past days, when the father of the king my lord was leading ..., I did not have to supply the deficits o f the palace of Ekallate, but now that the king, my lord, has exempted the Inner City and the ilku duty of the Inner City has been imposed on me, I have to supply (even) the deficits of the palace of Ekallate!
Are they ' sons of bought (slaves)' as they are called, or are they (in reality) exempts of the Palace Manager?
I have just made a list of the ' sons of bought (slaves)' and the ' sons of palace maids' on a writing board and am sending it herewith to the king, my lord. They are 370 men: 90 are king's men, 90 are reserves, 190 should do the king's work.

A letter from Aššur-reṣuwa came to me in which it was written that a messenger of the (king) of Ukku has gone to Urarṭu and that he has sent a letter about it to the Palace.
Now after this letter, on the evening of the 6th, he sent me the following letter of his: " The Ukkaean has gone to greet Arije. Over against him, there is a town of the Ukkaeans called Elizki in the pass of Kumme; the Ukkaean met Arije there, and when they were sitting there together, he spoke to him as follows:
' Go straight to ...; whether he will give you an ox, or a sheep or pig, take it!'

' 1,000 men ......

Paqaha told me: " I (must) personally take the lead of 100 men and spend a full month on the work. Let the king my lord call the leaders to account for the fact that I (must) spend a full month on the work employing (only) 100 men."

I went as far as Šabirešu to meet the people and oxen that were brought to me from Guzana; I checked them, received them, and provided them with shelter. Some of them were missing:
Kinâ, a wineskin-raft man, three persons; Sandapî, a vegetable gardener, three persons; Hulî, a farmer, five persons; Kuzâ, a belt-maker, four persons — in all 15 persons missing from my writing-board.
I sent the bodyguard from Šabirešu back to Guzana for them, telling him: " Go and get the rest of the people, and come and bring them to me!"
Last year, (when) the king my lord was in Babylon, they urged me to give a shipment of 200 reed altars for the work of the Nabû temple; now Aha-lurši has told me to make available another 200 reed altars.
Ubru-Babili is at the moment in the presence of the king, my lord; let them ask him; if he is going to give, then I too will give. What does the king my lord say?
Two liters of bread and two liters of beer for the exorcist; one liter of bread and one liter of beer for the lahhinu; in all, six liters of bread and beer being the surplus of the daily offerings of the Nabû temple.
The king, my lord, should know this; it is not available for any (other) purpose.
To the king, my lord: your servant Ṭab-šar-Aššur. Good health to the king, my lord!
A cohort commander of the Chief Eunuch delivered me the king's sealed message in the city of Anisu on the 27th.
The messenger of the commander of the fort came to me in Anisu; I asked him about the news, and he told me this: " The city of Birate and the whole land of Habhu are well; everybody is doing his work."
All is well; the king, my lord, can be glad.
On the 28th I shall be in the city of Ieri.
To the crown prince, my lord: your servant Nabû-riba-ahhe. Good health to the crown prince, my lord! The guards are very well.
The Sidonites and the(ir) heads did not go to Calah with the crown prince, my lord, nor are they serving in the garrison of Nineveh. They loiter in the center of the town, each in his lodging place.
To the king, my lord: your servant Amar-ili. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to the house of Mardû of which the king my lord told (me): " You and the governor of Arbela, divide it evenly between the sons of Mardû and give (each his share)!"
We did indeed find a writing-board inside (the house), just as the king my lord had written; I sealed it and put it inside (...).
Now I am sending it to the king, my lord. What are the king my lord's instructions?
To the king, my lord: your servant Ṭab-šar-Aššur. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to the gold for the winged claw of which the king, my lord, wrote to me,

As to the houses of the recruitment officers, about which the king, my lord, wrote to me: " The houses are already built, you are deceiving me in order to give them to your servants!" —
as if I did not tell the truth to the king, my lord! Let a royal eunuch who will tell the king my lord the truth come and have a look at these houses of the recruitment officers! If they are already built, let him go and tell it to the king, my lord, and let the king, my lord, hold his report to my discredit and say: " Why do you not tell me the truth?"
As to the houses of the servants of Šep-Aššur about which the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Why have you taken their houses and given them to your servants?"
When Šep-Aššur went to Ṣimirra, his servants went with him, so I took their houses and gave them to the Marqasians. Let Šep-Aššur rule as governor over there, but his servants must not have houses in Dur-Šarruken. Why should I not give them to the Marqasians, the king my lord's subjects?
Did I say to the king, my lord: " Šep-Aššur did not build a house all the while he was here"? Now, Šep-Aššur did build a house as governor of Dur-Šarruken; I was appointed in his stead, so I entered his house and took up residence in it.
To ...... for governorship ....... His servants went with him, and their ... should ... with him; the king's servants ......
The Marqasians, servants of the king, my lord, should live here ....

Upon my coming from Milqia to Dur-Šarruken, I was told that there had been an earthquake in Dur-Šarruken on the 9th of Adar (XII). Perhaps the king, my lord, now says: " Any damage within the city wall?"
There is none. The temples, the ziggurat, the palace, the city wall and the buildings of the city are all well; the king, my lord, can be glad.
The king, my lord, will hear many things tomorrow and the day after, and say: " Why is it that you heard but did not write?" That is why I am now writing to the king, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant Sin-ahhe-riba. Good health to the king, my lord! Assyria is well, the temples are well, all the king's forts are well. The king, my lord, can be glad indeed.
The emissaries of Commagene have come, bringing tribute and with it seven teams of mules. The tribute and the mules are entrusted in the Commagenean embassy, and the emissaries too are there, eating their own bread.
Should they (the tribute and the mules) be picked up and brought to Babylon, or can they be received here? Let them immediately write me what the king my lord commands.
They also brought red wool. The merchants told me that they have selected seven talents from it but that the Commageneans did not agree but said: " Who do you think you are? You are not to make the selection. Let them take it over and let the king's weavers make a selection over there."
The king, my lord, should write me to whom they are supposed to give it.
To the king, my lord: your servant Sin-ahhe-riba. Good health to the king, my lord! Assyria is well, the temples are well, all the king's forts are well. The king, my lord, can be glad indeed.
The Ukkaean has sent me (this message): " The troops of the Urarṭian king have been utterly defeated on his expedition against the Cimmerians; eleven of his governors have been eliminated with their troops; his commander-in-chief and two of his governors have been taken prisoners. He (himself) came to take the road to ...... came ...... the prefects of his country ...... stationed in ......."
This was the report of the Ukkaean. Aššur-reṣuwa has written to me thus:
" The previous report which I sent about the Urarṭians was that they had suffered a terrible defeat. Now his country is quiet again and each of his magnates has gone to his province. Kaqqadanu, his commander-in-chief, has been taken prisoner; the Urarṭian king is in the province of Wazaun."
This was the report of Aššur-reṣuwa. Nabû-le'i the governor of Birate has written to me:
" I have written to the guards of the forts along the border concerning the news of the Urarṭian king and they (tell me this): ' His troops have been utterly defeated on his expedition against the Cimmerians. Three of his magnates along with their troops have been killed; he himself has escaped and entered his country, but his army has not yet arrived (back).'"
This was the report of Nabû-le'i. The (king) of Muṣaṣir and his brother and son have gone to greet the Urarṭian king, and the messenger of the (king) of Hubuškia has also gone to greet him.
All the guards of the forts along the border have sent me similar reports.
They have brought me from Tabal a letter from Nabû-le'i, the major-domo of Ahat-abiša. I am herewith forwarding it to the king, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant Sin-ahhe-riba. Good health to the king, my lord! Assyria is well, the temples are well, all the king's forts are well. The king, my lord, can be glad indeed.
They are working on the fort in Kumme; their work ... is making good progress. A messenger of Arije has come into my presence (with the following message):
" The (ruler) of Ukku has written to the Urarṭian king that the governors of the king of Assyria are building a fort in Kumme, and the Urarṭian king has given his governors (the following) order: ' Take your troops, go and capture the governors of the king of Assyria alive from the Kummeans, and bring them to me.' I do not have the full details yet; as soon as I have heard more, I shall write by express to the crown prince that they should rush troops to me."
This was the report of Arije; on the 11th of Elul (VI) I got a letter from Aššur-reṣuwa:
" The Urarṭian did not achieve anything on the venture on which the Zikirteans took him, but had to return empty-handed; he went with his troops to Waisi, entered the city and left his forces there. Taking but a few troops with him, he set out and entered into the territory of the Manneans. I have not heard about the invasion yet, but I shall write you as soon as I have heard more.
" The governor opposite me was (also) in Waisi; I have heard that he left and went off after the king's departure, but nobody has seen him come out of Waisi. They are improving the roads leading to me and constructing bridges; as soon as I have heard what it is all about, whether he his coming with his troops or whether he is ' clean', I shall immediately write to the crown prince."
This was the report of Aššur-reṣuwa; the (ruler) of Arzabia has written to me thus:
" The (ruler) of Ukku must be kept away from me; why do you keep silent while he is trying to destroy me?" I have sent my bodyguard to the Ukkean (with this message): " Don't argue with the Arzabian! Until the king comes, I will arbitrate between you!"
A messenger of the Mannean (king) has come to me bringing a horse as the audience gift and giving me the regards of the Mannean. I dressed him (in purple) and put a silver bracelet on his arm.
The tribute of the Ashdodites was brought to Calah; I have received it, sealed it and deposited it in the ... palace. I am sending this letter to the king, my lord, on the 11th of Elul.

May he see the workmanship of the temples of his gods and kiss their beautiful feet; may those (gods) whose temples you have made shine like sunrise, bless the king my lord, and may we, the royal servants, kiss the feet of the king, our lord.

The sons of Sadir petitioned the Palace claiming they had weakened (financially), and they say: " We have been authorized by the Palace to raise the iškāru dues from the troops";

The king's word to Mannu-ki-Adad:
1,119 able-bodied men — all together they were 5,000 persons, those of them who have died have died, and those who are alive are alive — were given to the exempts of the Palace and entrusted as charges to your care. So why are you appropriating them, turning some to recruits, others to chariot-men, and others again to cavalrymen, into your own regular troops?
Have you not said to yourself: " When the time comes for me to summon them, to whose house shall I go for help?"
I am writing to you right now: You have sent many of them to the south and to the north or wherever on (various) errands; summon them wherever they are, they must be there before my eunuch arrives. I shall now send my eunuch to make a review of them.
The king's word to Ašipâ: As to these Nabateans about whom you wrote, they are at your disposal.
The king's word to Nabu-duru-uṣur:
Right now I am sending the royal bodyguard Mannu-ki-Aššur to those Urarṭian emissaries: he will bring them to Urzuhina in advance of these captives who are eating bread in your charge.
As for you, the day you see this letter, summon these captives; they should be on the alert, standing by, and the day Mannu-ki-Aššur the bodyguard writes to you: " The emissaries have arrived in Urzuhina, set the captives in motion," assemble the captives, go to Urzuhina, and entrust them ... to the the city-overseer of Urzuhina.
I am also sending Aššur-balti-niše (with the following orders): " Go ...... in the presence of ...... and assist them!" Indeed, the Urarṭi an women who are in your charge with these captives in Arrapha, should not go with the captives!
But now the women whom he is seeking, taking out and bringing to ..., should live with these women in Arrapha, and should be given bread to eat and water to drink until I come. The palace chariots which are bringing these women are to provide the people with bread and the teams with fodder.

The town of Hēsa, a road station of mine, lacks people; the postmaster and the commander of the recruits are there alone and cannot attend to it (properly). Now, let me get together 30 families and place them there. There are men of Nabû-ṣalla the prefect living in Hēsa, a cohort of craftsmen; let him move them out, settle them in the town of Argite, and give them fields and gardens.
If it is acceptable to the king, my lord, let them send a letter to Nabû-uṣalla the prefect, and let me appoint Ia'iru the deputy as village manager there, and Sin-iddina, the major-domo of Adda-hati in Sazanâ, so they will attend to these road stations and fear the king.

Perhaps the king, my lord, will say: " Where will the bed enter?" In the house of the treasurer of the Aššur temple, where the gods of the city of Dur-Šarruken are staying.
Right now I am personally bringing in the monsters; but the bed is on the river and will stay in the boat for tonight. We shall also spend the night on the river and keep watch over it, until the king, our lord, sends me instructions. Let him give orders to a messenger, and let the messenger come straight away.

As to the work assignment of the governor of Calah about which the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Why has the governor of Arrapha left half of the gate to him?"
On the 3rd, when they started on the city wall, they came to me, saying: " Come and settle our work allocation between us!" I went and settled it between them. Perhaps the king, my lord, now says: " Why ......"
Out of the ... work assignment (units) of the governor of Calah, that of the wall reached as far as the edge of the gate of the Tower of People, and out of the 850 work assignment (units) of the governor of Arrapha, the wall (assignment) extended as far as the edge of the gate of the Tower of People.
I deducted this (stretch of) wall from the gate (assignment), calculated the bricks for the balance of the gate, and gave three fourths to the governor of Arrapha and ... one fourth to the governor of Calah even before the king's sealed message had come to me.
The governor of Calah did not know that his wall assignment extended only as far as the edge of the gate, and that is why he said: " I have too large an assignment." I have now arbitrated between them and they are both doing their work.

Let them order the governor of Calah to appoint a eunuch of his in charge of the Arabs under his jurisdiction; they should (then) ask me for a territory where to graze. All the same, their tents should remain in the territory of the governor of Calah (while) they are grazing in ......

I wrote to the king, my lord, but only got 260 horses and 13 small boys. 267 horses and 28 men — I have 527 horses and 28 men, all told. I have been writing to wherever there are king's men, but they have not come. The scribe is with the king, my lord; the king, my lord, should ask him.

I impressed upon the deputies that it was a royal command that they should bring the people into fortified places where there is good water. They said to me: "......
...... men .... in the olden times ... I sent ... to them. Now, I sent their prefect to them (with this message): " Come! Let me review you, take you down into the mother (town) and give you equipment." They did not obey at all; they didn't come but assaulted their prefect.
There is a town called Lapsija at the foot of the mountain; I went there and sent the major-domo to them (with this message): " Come, I want to speak with you." They got up and fled, he did not find anybody there.

For this very reason I relieved him of his office as major-domo, removed him and let you settle him in his house in the center of Arrapha.
What he did was perpetually slander Arrapheans in your presence and keep putting inhabitants of Arrapha to the sword. I consequently removed him from Arrapha and appointed him in Lubda. The same things again; he did not change his ways.
Bel-nuri is not a good man in the field, nor does he further the interests of his superiors when at home. Did I not say: " (If) you like him for what he is, why am I not intensely loved?" That you like Bel-nuri and have placed him around your neck like this seal ...

I did not agree to give it to him, so he went and opened a silo in one of my villages, brought in his measurers and poured out x sound men's worth of (grain).
I went and remonstrated him, saying: " Why did you self- willedly, without the permission of the deputy (governor) open the king's granaries?" He would not look me in the eye but said:
" My (supply of) grass diminished in Nisan, and horses keep coming to me; I cannot cope."

As to Marduk-remanni and the ... of the Inner City about whom the king my lord wrote to me, I have appointed them in charge of Aššur-of-Lions at ... and impressed upon them: " Watch out ... and do your work!"

As to the ... wall behind (the image) of Ishtar of which the king my lord told (me): " Place the symbol where it goes up and ...; if the wall is leaning, write me" —
Now on the 4th, the wall caved in by itself. PN and the master-builders came to see it, and they said: " The wall is ruined; let them remove ... and change .... The ... that the king ordered ...."
A wall which ... which the king ... knows! All is well, the king my lord can be glad.
He should go .... As far as the wall behind the god is concerned, the king my lord can be glad.
On the ... th, after ...... we had finished the (city) wall, we got busy, gathered men for the straw that the king had given to us in Halahhu, and went to carry it over.
The men working in the ditch, of a single prefect and 125 in number, have neither delivered straw of their own nor are they carrying that of Halahhu. By means of what will they glaze bricks for their work-quota tomorrow? What does the king my lord say?
As to the replacement for the dead concerning which the king told the magnates: " Provide the replacement!" — nobody has given us anything. The deficit of our dead and invalid soldiers who did not go to the campaign with us is 1, 200; the magnates won't give it to us, nor have they given their straw, nor have they worked with us.
A letter from Arihu to Nabû-duri-uṣur. Good health to my lord!
As to the corn tax of the Samarians, my lord should send a notice whether it exists or not, and let us be content with that. The officials are passive, they keep where they are, they don't go to do their work, nor can we give them orders.
I have been petitioning you since last year until now in this very manner about the income, but we have not brought in any income whatever. Now send a notice whether it exists or not!

Bahianu being the key witness to the crimes committed by Bel-lu-balaṭ, my lord wrote to me: " Let Bahianu come here." He (= Bel-lu-balaṭ) heard (of this) and ambushed 50 men on Mt. Kukab before his arrival. They killed Bahianu along with his attendants and took three minas of gold, two talents of silver, four mules and ten donkeys.
... si heard (of this), went in pursuit after them, killed ... men of them, and retrieved the mules and the donkeys. He captured ... men from among them and questioned them; they said: " Bel-lu-balaṭ sent us ......

As to these people, the king's subjects, about whom the king my lord wrote to me, none of them are their servants. The king, my lord, should question these people who came: not a single man among them is a farmer, they are their litigants and creditors, relatives of the (king) of Carchemish. They will write down their report and communicate it to the Palace.
Now, people have got afraid at the king their lord's ilku duty and grumbled: " Why are they persecuting us month after month?" They keep escaping one by one and resettle in the district of Arpad, beyond the River (Euphrates), as though the king, my lord, were trying this country.

We set out ......, and thanks to the gods who are well disposed towards the king and have accepted your gift with pleasure, we passed the Maliasû river like a quiet river bed.
I arrived at the Inner City on the 18th. The inhabitants of the Inner City acted in the same way (as before): offering tables were set up and sacrifices were being made. They anchored the boats on the river before the Gate of Aššur. My canopy was set up aboard, and I am staying on the river and keeping watch until the day I depart. The king, my lord, can be pleased indeed.
As long as the bed is aboard, regular sheep offerings are being made in front of it.
Perhaps the king, my lord, will say: " When are you going to depart from the Inner City ......?" I am waiting ... for the troops; right now ...... the governor of Arrapha ......

As to Ilu-pija-uṣur the shepherd about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me: " You have removed him from the office of cohort commander! Why did you tell him to exact a talent of silver?" —
indeed I have not removed him, he is (still) a cohort commander! Dugul-pan-ili is with the king my lord; let the king my lord ask him if he is not a cohort commander!
When Dugul-pan-ili went to the shearing, that person stole his (sheep) dues; he did not come in to the shearing but fled and took refuge in a temple. I sent (men) to take him down and (told him): " I will excuse your dues (but) bring the men, come and do (your) work in Dur-Šarruken."
He brought half of the men but did not bring the other half, so their work assignment is in arrears. I said to them: " Why is your work behind schedule, and why have you not delivered straw and reeds for the work?" They responded: " Who ......

The king my lord told me: " Nobody will pay back your loans until the work on Dur-Šarruken is finished!" —
(Now) they have refunded to the merchants (loans on) the portion of Dur-Šarruken that has been constructed, but nobody has reminded (the king) about me; 570 minas of silver with my seal and due this year have not been repaid as yet.
When the king, my lord, sold gold and precious stones on my account, I told the king, my lord, that my father was much in debt to Har..., Huziru and .... After my father('s death) I paid half of his debts, but now their sons are telling me: " Pay us the debts that your father owes to our fathers!"

To the king, my lord: your servant Bel-duri.
The king, my lord, gave orders: " All governors may raise food and fodder from the villages of the desert with you, and Adad-isse'a and Bel-lešir are to support Abi-lešir!"
They have not agreed to this though, but are disobedient, saying: " Why should our villages in the desert belong to all the governors? The villages are ... within each other!"
The king, my lord, should send word that they are to write down their desert villages. Ever since the king my lord has levied pack animals from Hamath, I have been on my own, and he (= Abi-lešir) and they (= Adad-isse'a and Bel-lešir) have been on their own. Tomorrow the king my lord will surely kill me, saying: " You are but a bunch of do-nothings!"

The king installed Ilu-mušezib, a baker of Bel-emuranni, in Hatarikka. When the king passed on, Kubaba-ereš a (member) of his community and the (members) of the community of his relatives made him run away. They should make inquiries and return the man to me.
When there was an epidemic here, Ilu-bi'di a cohort commander of the ... under my jurisdiction killed a horse. I made up for the horse in his stead and he promised: " I'll give you the money." Now this Ilu-bi'di has died; his wife, as the king knows, has married a young boy and that person has been serving under me as a cook.

If Mati'-ilu sins against this sworn treaty, then, just as this spring lamb has been brought from its fold and will not return to its fold and not behold its fold again, (in like manner) may, alas, Mati'-ilu, together with his sons, magnates and the people of his land be ousted from his country, not return to his country, and not behold his country again.

May Adad, the canal inspector of heaven and earth, put an end to Mati'-ilu, his land, and the people of his land through hunger, want, and famine, may they eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and may it taste as good to them as the flesh of spring lambs.

These are the ports of trade and the trade routes which Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, entrusted to his servant Baal: to Akko, Dor, to the entire district of the Philistines, and to all the cities within Assyrian territory on the seacoast, and to Byblos, the Lebanon, all the cities in the mountains, all (these) being cities of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria.

(This is) the treaty which Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, has concluded with you, in the presence of the great gods of heaven and earth, on behalf of Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, son of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, your lord, whom he has named and appointed to the crown-princeship:
When Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, passes away, you will seat Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, upon the royal throne, and he will exercise the kingship and lordship of Assyria over you. You shall protect him in country and in town, fall and die for him. You shall speak with him in the truth of your heart, give him sound advice loyally, and smooth his way in every respect.
You shall not depose him nor seat (any)one of his brothers, elder or younger, on the throne of Assyria in stead of him.
You shall neither change nor alter the word of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, but serve this very Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, whom Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, your lord, has presented to you, and he shall exercise the kingship and dominion over you.
You shall protect Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, whom Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, has presented and ordered for you, and on behalf of whom he has confirmed and concluded (this) treaty with you; you shall not sin against him, nor bring your hand against him with evil intent, nor revolt or do anything to him which is not good and proper;
you shall not oust him from the kingship of Assyria by helping one of his brothers, elder or younger, to seize the throne of Assyria in his stead, nor set any other king or any other lord over you, nor swear an oath to any other king or any other lord.
If you hear any improper, unsuitable or unseemly word concerning the exercise of kingship which is unseemly and evil against Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, either from the mouth of his brothers, his uncles, his cousins, his family (var. his people), members of his father's line; or from the mouth of magnates and governors, or from the mouth of the bearded and the eunuchs, or from the mouth of the scholars or from the mouth of any human being at all, you shall not conceal it but come and report it to Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate.
If Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, passes away while his sons are minors, you will help Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, to take the throne of Assyria, and you will help Šamaš-šumu-ukin, his equal brother, the crown prince designate of Babylon, to ascend the throne of Babylon. You will reserve for him the kingship over the whole of Sumer, Akkad and Karduniaš. He will take with him all the gifts that Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, his father, gave him; do not hold back even one.
You shall keep absolute honesty with respect to Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate whom Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, has presented to you, and (with respect to) his brothers, sons by the same mother as Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, on behalf of whom Esarhaddon, king of Assyria has concluded (this) treaty with you; you shall always serve them in a true and fitting manner, speak with them with heartfelt truth, and protect them in country and in town.
You shall not sin against Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, whom Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, has ordered for you, nor against his brothers, sons by the same mother as Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, concerning whom he has concluded (this) treaty with you; you shall not bring your hands to (do) evil against them nor make insurrection or do anything which is not good to them.
If you hear any evil, improper, ugly word which is not seemly nor good to Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, son of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, your lord, either from the mouth of his enemy or from the mouth of his ally, or from the mouth of his brothers or from the mouth of his uncles, his cousins, his family, members of his father's line, or from the mouth of your brothers, your sons, your daughters, or from the mouth of a prophet, an ecstatic, an inquirer of oracles, or from the mouth of any human being at all, you shall not conceal it but come and report it to Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, son of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria.
You shall not do (anything) that is evil and improper to Assurbanipal the great crown prince designate, whom Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, has ordered for you; you shall not seize him and put him to death, nor hand him over to his enemy, nor oust him from the kingship of Assyria, nor swear an oath to any other king or any other lord.
If anyone should speak to you of rebellion and insurrection (with the purpose) of killing, assassinating, and eliminating Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, son of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, your lord, concerning whom he has concluded (this) treaty with you, or if you should hear it from the mouth of anyone, you shall seize the perpetrators of insurrection, and bring them before Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate.
If you are able to seize them and put them to death, then you shall destroy their name and their seed from the land. If, however, you are unable to seize them and put them to death, you shall inform Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, and assist him in seizing and putting to death the perpetrators of rebellion.
If you should come into contact with perpetrators of insurrection, be they few or many, and hear (anything, be it) favourable or unfavourable, you shall come and report it to Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, son of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, being totally loyal to him.
You shall not take a mutually binding oath with (any)one who produces (statues of) gods in order to conclude a treaty before gods, (be it) by setting a table, by drinking from a cup, by kindling a fire, by water, by oil, or by holding breasts, but you shall come and report to Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, son of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, your lord, and shall seize and put to death the perpetrators of insurrection and the traitorous troops, and destroy their name and seed from the land.
If an Assyrian or a vassal of Assyria, or a bearded (courtier) or a eunuch, or a citizen of Assyria or a citizen of any other country, or any living being at all besieges Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, in country or in town, and carries out rebellion and insurrection,
you shall take your stand with and protect Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, wholeheartedly defeat the men who revolted against him, and rescue Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, and his brothers, sons by the same mother.
You shall not make common cause with (any)one who may revolt against Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, son of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, your lord, concerning whom he has concluded (this) treaty with you, but, should they seize you by force, you shall flee and come to Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate.
You shall not, whether while on a guard duty ...... or on a day of rest, while residing within the land or while entering a tax-collection point, set in your mind an unfavourable thought against Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate; you shall not revolt against him, nor make rebellion, nor do anything to him which is not good.
On the day that Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, your lord passes away, (on that day) Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, son of Esarhaddon, your lord, shall be your king and your lord; he shall abase the mighty, raise up the lowly, put to death him who is worthy of death, and pardon him who deserves to be pardoned.
You shall hearken to whatever he says and do whatever he commands, and you shall not seek any other king or any other lord against him.
If anyone in the Palace makes an insurrection, whether by day or by night, whether on a campaign or within the land against Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, you must not obey him.
If a messenger from within the Palace at an unexpected time, whether by day or by night, comes to the prince saying: " Your father has summoned you; let my lord come", you must not listen to him nor let him go away but you must guard him strongly until one of you, who loves his lord and feels concern over the house of his lords, goes to the palace and ascertains the well-being of the king, his lord.

You shall not do for him what is not good, nor give him an improper counsel or direct him in an unwholesome course, but continually serve him in a true and fitting manner.
If Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, passes away during the minority of his sons, and if either a bearded (courtier) or a eunuch puts Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, to death, and takes over the kingship of Assyria, you shall not make common cause with him and become his servant but shall break away and be hostile (to him), alienate all lands from him, instigate a rebellion against him, seize him and put him to death, and then help a son of Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate to take the throne of Assyria.

Speak evil and improper things about him," you shall not make it come to a fight between him and his father by stirring up mutual hatred between them.
(Instead) say to the envious person who commands you and would make you become accursed: " Where are his brothers or the servants who made themselves accursed to his father by slandering him in the presence of his father? Has not what Aššur, Šamaš and Adad said about him proved to be true? Did your father ...... without (the consent of) Aššur and Šamaš? Let your brother be honoured, and stay alive."
If someone involves you in a plot, be it one of his brothers, his uncles, his relations, a member of his father's line, a eunuch or a bearded (courtier), an Assyrian or a foreigner, or any human being at all, saying: " Slander his brothers, sons by his own mother, before him, make it come to a fight between them, and divide his brothers, sons of his own mother, from him", you shall not obey nor speak evil about his brothers in his presence, nor divide him from his brothers; you shall not let those who speak such things go free but shall come and report to Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate as follows: " Your father imposed a treaty on us and made us swear an oath concerning it."

May these gods be our witnesses: we will not make rebellion or insurrection against Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, or against Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, or against his brothers, sons by the same mother as Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, and the rest of the sons of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, or make common cause with his enemy.
Should we hear of instigation to armed rebellion, agitation or malicious whispers, evil, unseemly things, or treacherous, disloyal talk against Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, and against his brothers by the same mother as Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, we will not conceal it but will report it to Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, our lord.

May they (= all the gods) spin you around like a spindle-whorl, may they make you like a woman before your enemy.
Ditto, ditto; may they (= all the gods) make you, your brothers and your sons go backward like a crab.
May they make evil and wicked things surround you like fire.
Just as oil enters (your) flesh, so may they cause this oath to enter into your flesh and the flesh of your sons.
Just as the Cursers sinned against Bel and he cut off their hands and feet and blinded their eyes, so may they annihilate you, and make you sway like reeds in water; may your enemy pull you out like reeds from a bundle.
If you should forsake Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate, and the other sons, the offspring of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, going to the south or to the north, may iron swords consume him who goes to the south and may iron swords likewise consume him who goes to the north;

... 12. A tablet of Budilu, the scribe ......
...... of all the temples of ......
The rites which are performed in Egašankalamma are enacted like those of Nippur.
The ...... is Ištar, when she wept and bitterly lamented for Ištaran, her brother, lifted her hands (in prayer), went into the temple of Ištar, and saw the corpse of Ištaran, (his) blood flowing down to the underworld.
The ...... which one prepares is Ea, whom Bel pushed away from his breast, sending him down to the Abyss.
The bundles of reeds which one prepares is Bel, treading on the necks of his ... relentless enemies.
The chariots which they dispatch from the steppe, and which enter the city, is Nabû, who slew Anzû.
The kurgarrû and the horse trainer, who wash each other in water — the horse trainer is Bel, the assinnu is Illil, when Bel consigned Illil to the underworld.
The cup which is prepared for you is the cup of Aššur, because Bel went and defeated Anu, pulled away his hide and assigned his corpse to the Anunnaki, (saying) " Anu is defeated along with you!"
Having flayed his hide, and having clothed Orion with his blood, he stepped upon the cut-off head of Anu.
The bread which one prepares is Ea, (whom) he vanquished.
(When) Marduk got up and ascended behind Orion, Ea stood behind him, and having girt his loins
and defeated Orion, Bel recited the incantation of Ea and consigned him to the Anunnaki.
The women who ......, ... who lifts the spindle and hides stones amid the women,
is Nabû, his great heir, whom his father and mother took and sheltered between the breasts of goddesses.
For 7 days he entrusted him the dust of the incantation of Ea, and he turned the goddesses who were with him to dust.
The ... which comes out and shouts continually, is Nanaya, when she gave iron arrow(s) to Bel.
...... is when Ninurta stood over Illil and turned him to dust.
The fox which comes out howling, is Nergal ...... when Nusku lifted a bright torch in front of Bel.
The woman whom the city carries on their heads ...... and necks (while) they go to a field and scatter seed, is Marduk, when he trampled the necks of those disobedient to him. They scatter as much seed as fits in their hands because he ' filled them to the brim'.
The table which they set in the courtyard before Šamaš and call ... a well, is Šamaš, when he ... to Illil.
The ... who squeezes, ... draws a magic circle, hangs up sheep and places (them) on the table, the women who cut the upper parts, take out the intestines and deposit them onto their laps,

His death is when they burn the roasted barley, which they were casting on Tammuz, on the stones. The burned parts which are produced go up to the upper regions, as it is said. The image of your brother which they soak in beer lifts up the body of the brother, as it is said.
Honey is the pus of the kidnapped god.
Tamarisk is his topknot. Cypress is his trunk.
Cannabis is his bristle. Juniper is his thighs.
Cedar is his knees. The medlar is his ankle bones.

When Ṣallâ had not yet met his fate, he, a lowly ... — the king did not know him —, a slave waiting upon Šamaš-ibni, the son of a lowly fisherman, not suitable for kingship, the shit bucket of Zeru-kinu, an empty talker, a raped comrade of Nummuraya, ...... said:
" In Assyria and in Babylonia there is no-one equal to me! The woman Nasqat has praised me; where in the whole world is my rival?"
......... her, who did ... to him reverently.

... spoke foolishness with him:
" Who has taken from me the son of Bibie, who has darkened your radiant countenance?"
Later, by way of purification, she called his name ' angry Pazuzu, the son of Hanbi.' In the face of this, mankind humbly bowed down, saying: " This is correct behaviour, reverence!
" This is the stele which the prostitute set up for the son of Ibâ, the farter, and left for posterity."
Indeed in the whole, in the heart of this, there is this teaching for the future: Like one who is lacking in understanding, incompetent, he praised himself, pouring his endless obscenities from his heart.
He himself did the talking, he himself did the praising, he himself did the saying, he himself did the glorifying, and became a proverbial expression and obscenity in the mouth of mankind.
And as for him, he did not know how to reason with his heart.
It is a not (deeply) incised hand, this which I wrote, very tiny ......

I constantly speak in praise of you, Nabû, in the assembly of the great gods; may the host of those who wish me ill not take possession of my life!
In the temple of the Queen of Nineveh I approach you, hero among the gods, his brothers; you are the trust of Assurbanipal for ever and ever!
Ever since I was a small child I have lain at the feet of Nabû; do not abandon me to the assembly of my ill-wishers, O Nabû!"
Pay attention, Assurbanipal! I am Nabû. Until the end of time your feet shall not grow slack, your hands not tremble; your lips shall not become weary in praying to me; your tongue shall not falter on your lips,
Because I will endow you with pleasant speech. I will lift your head and straighten your body in the House of Emašmaš.
Nabû continues: " That pleasant mouth of yours which constantly prays to Urkittu; your figure, which I created, prays incessantly to me in Emašmaš.
" Your fate, which I devised, incessantly prays to me thus: ' Bring safety into Egašankalamma!'
" Your soul incessantly prays to me: ' Prolong the life of Assurbanipal!'"
Assurbanipal is on his knees, praying incessantly to Nabû, his lord: Please, Nabû, do not abandon me! My life is written before you, my soul is deposited in the lap of Mullissu.
Please, powerful Nabû, do not abandon me among those who wish me ill!
A dream god answered from the presence of Nabû, his lord:
Fear not, Assurbanipal! I will give you long life, I will entrust pleasant breezes with your soul; my pleasant mouth shall ever bless you in the assembly of the great gods.
Assurbanipal opened his hands, praying incessantly to Nabû, his lord:
May he who grasped the feet of the Queen of Nineveh not come to shame in the assembly of the great gods; may he who sits next to Urkittu not come to shame in the assembly of those who wish him ill!
Do not abandon me to the assembly of those who wish me ill, O Nabû! Do not abandon my life to the assembly of my adversaries!"
You were a child, Assurbanipal, when I left you with the Queen of Nineveh; you were a baby, Assurbanipal, when you sat in the lap of the Queen of Nineveh! Her four teats are placed in your mouth; two you suck, and two you milk to your face.
Your ill-wishers, Assurbanipal, will fly away like pollen on the surface of the water. They will be squashed before your feet like burbillātu insects in spring!
You, Assurbanipal, you will stand before the great gods and praise Nabû!

The flour which is much too plentiful for Nisan, is the flour which was there when he was taken prisoner.

The (outfit) of his crime is gathered in the storeroom. He is not dressed in water. The chamber .......
The race which they go round in front of Bel and in all the cult cities in Kislev is that of Ninurta.

All the talk which they talk among the lamentation priests, and the acts of robbery which they commit against him and afflict him with are the gods, his fathers, coming up.
The dog which crosses Esabad is a messenger. Gula is sending it to him.
The shoe which they bring to the temple of the Lady of Babylon is a token. He sends it to her, because they will not let him go out.
The chariot which goes to the Akitu temple and comes back has no driver. Without a driver, it rocks about.

the gods of heaven and earth, and all the gods of Assyria curse him with an indissoluble, grievous curse and not have mercy on him all the days of his life. May they remove his name and seed from the country and put his flesh in the mouth of a dog.

and woke up the sleeper. Taboo of Enmešarra.
The upper heaven of luludanitu stone is Anu's. He settled the 300 Igigi gods there.

The wild ass is the ghost of Illil; the wolf is the ghost of Anu. Bel made him roam the plain. The gazelles, his daughters, Bel made to roam the plain.
The dromedary is the ghost of Tiamat. Bel cut off her horns, clove her feet and docked her tail. Bel vanquished her and displayed her to mankind, lest she be forgotten. Its name is tamriqātu, as it is said among the people: ētamar qātāia (" He learned from my example").
The singed ox and sheep, which which they throw alive to the ground, are Qingu and his seven sons, when they were smitten.
The dove which they throw down, is Tiamat: they cast her down and kill her.
The king, who wears on his head a golden tiara from the inside of the temple and sits on a sedan chair, while they carry him and go to the palace, is Ninurta, who avenged his father. The gods, his fathers, decorated him inside the Ekur, gave him the sceptre, throne and the staff, adorned him with the splendour of kingship, and he went out to the mountain.
The cedar (resin) which they burn in front of them is the loose flesh of the evil gods; they smelled the scent and went into hiding.

Tablet of Kiṣir-Aššur, exorcist of the temple of Aššur, son of Nabû-bessunu, exorcist of the temple of Aššur, son of Baba-šuma-ibni, the zabardabbu official of Ešarra.
May Šamaš, king of heaven and earth, elevate you to shepherdship over the four regions!
May Aššur, who gave you the sceptre, lengthen your days and years!
Spread your land wide at your feet!
May Šerua extol your name to your god!
Just as grain and silver, oil, the cattle of Šakkan and the salt of Bariku are good, so may Assurbanipal, king of Assyria, be agreeable to the gods of his land!
May eloquence, understanding, truth and justice be given to him as a gift!
May the people of Assur buy 30 kor of grain for one shekel of silver! May the people of Assur buy 3 seah of oil for one shekel of silver! May the people of Assur buy 30 minas of wool for one shekel of silver!
May the lesser speak, and the greater listen! May the greater speak, and the lesser listen! May concord and peace be established in Assyria!
Aššur is king — indeed Aššur is king! Assurbanipal is the representative of Aššur, the creation of his hands.
May the great gods make firm his reign, may they protect the life of Assurbanipal, king of Assyria!
May they give him a straight sceptre to extend the land and his peoples!
May his reign be renewed, and may they consolidate his royal throne for ever!
May they bless him (by) day, month, and year, and guard his reign!
In his years may there constantly be rain from the heavens and flood from the (underground) source.
Give our lord Assurbanipal long days, copious years, strong weapons, a long reign, years of abundance, a good name, fame, happiness and joy, auspicious oracles, and leadership over (all other) kings.
After he has pronounced the blessing, he turns and pronounces the (following) blessing at the opening of the censer (placed) before Šamaš:
Anu gave his crown, Illil gave his throne; Ninurta gave his weapon; Nergal gave his luminous splendour. Nusku sent and placed advisers before him.
He who speaks with the king disloyally or treasonably — if he is a notable, he will die a violent death; if he is a rich man, he will become poor.
He who in his heart plots evil against the king — Erra will call him to account in a bout of plague.
He who in his heart utters improprieties against the king — his foundation is (but) wind, the hem of his garment is (but) litter.
Gather, all the gods of heaven and earth, bless king Assurbanipal, the circumspect man!
Place in his hand the weapon of war and battle, give him the black-headed people, that he may rule as their shepherd!

Exalt and glorify the Lady of Nineveh, magnify and praise the Lady of Arbela, who have no equal among the great gods!
Their names are most precious among the goddesses! Their cult centres have no equal among all the shrines!
A word from their lips is blazing fire! Their utterances are valid for ever!
I am Assurbanipal, their favourite, most valued seed of Assur, offspring of Nineveh, product of Emašmaš and Egašankalamma, whose kingship they made great even in the House of Succession. In their pure mouths is voiced the endurance of my throne.
I knew no father or mother, I grew up in the lap of my goddesses. As a child the great gods guided me, going with me on the right and the left.
They established at my side a good genie and a good angel, assigned my life to guardians of well-being and health.
They glorified my stature and fortified my strength; they spread my fame over all rulers.
All enemies heard (of me), all the recalcitrant lands, which did not submit to the kings, my fathers, and did not bring tribute and gifts before them, trembled with fear.
I am Assurbanipal, the creation of the hands of the great gods.

Unceasingly, yearly they bring me sumptuous presents and protect daily the gate of Aššur and Mullissu.
They seek peace with me in prayer and in supplication; with observance and prayers, they kiss my feet.
As for me, Assurbanipal, scion of kingship, who slays the recalcitrant and calms the heart of the gods, the great gods gave me confidence, and blessed my weapons.
The Lady of Nineveh, the mother who bore me, endowed me with unparalleled kingship; the Lady of Arbela, my creator, ordered everlasting life (for me).
They decreed as my fate to exercise dominion over all inhabited regions, and made their kings bow down at my feet.
May the Lady of Nineveh, the lady of (this) song, magnify my kingship for ever!

In my intense prayers and righteousness I daily spoke with my heart, saying: " Who can comprehend any of the deeds of the gods? Let me introduce into myself reverence for their godhead, seize the shaft of their (yoke), ......., frequent their holy places, and let me ......."
While thus reverently pondering in my heart over the deeds of the gods, the death of Sargon, my father, who was slain in the enemy country and who was not interred in his house occurred to my mind, and I said to myself:
" Let me investigate by means of extispicy the sin of Sargon, my father, let me then find out the circumstances, learn the ......; let me make the sin he committed against the god an abomination to myself, and with God's help let me save myself."
I went and collected the haruspices, the courtiers of my palace guarding the mystery of god and king; I split them into several groups so that they could not approach or speak to one another. I investigated the sins of Sargon, my father, by extispicy, enquiring of Šamaš and Adad as follows:
" Was it because he esteemed the gods of Assyria too much, placing them above the gods of Babylonia ......, (and was it) because he did not keep the treaty of the king of gods, that Sargon my father was slain in the enemy country and was not buried in his house?"
...... The haruspices whom I had split into several groups unanimously gave me a reliable answer in the affirmative. ...... I opened my hands (in prayer) and lifted my hands, and in supplication and humility I prayed on account of Sargon, my father: "......

...... After I had inquired (the will of) Šamaš and Adad, I lifted my hands and prayed on account of the statue of Marduk, saying: " May it be done!"

By Aššur, the divine king, the god who created me; (by) queen Mullissu, the divine empress who vanquishes all enemies; (by) Sin, who glorifies my exalted priesthood; (by) Šamaš, who stabilizes my royal throne:

Just as I, when I was to make the statue of Aššur the great lord, and the statue of Marduk, the great lord, and to set aright the rites and ordinances of Assyria and Babylonia, in performing the extispicy split the haruspices into several groups, so you too, like me, divide the haruspices into several groups, announce your query to the haruspices who stand at the site, and have them perform the extispicy and look at the features.
Let (then) the remaining haruspices who were divided as a separate group study the features, find out the will of Šamaš and Adad, and tell it to you!
As for me, after I had made the statue of Aššur my lord, Assyrian scribes wrongfully prevented me from working on the statue of Marduk and did not let me make the statue of Marduk, the great lord, and (thus) shortened my life. .......
(However), the grand scheme of mine which from times immemorial none of my royal predecessors had brought into realization , I have (now) communicated to you; ......

Ereškigal appeared in a dream in the middle of the night and said to him: " There was an offering (made) by you; let me hear your prayers that I may fulfill your desire.
"... happened by the command of my great divinity; I shall not answer ....... Why did you turn to me, ignoring Šamaš?"
Kummâ awakened, mourned like a dove, and weeping "... my ground, my ground ...," he cursed again and again the dream.
Once again he lifted his hands and prayed to Ereškigal, his tears flowing before Nergal, king of the wide underworld, her spouse:
"...... as substitutes for you the widespread peoples ......; they will cause storerooms to bulge out .......
"... creature ... a pig turns upside down .... Unveil the face of the secret, decree .........!"
Kummâ lay down to sleep and saw a night vision. In his dream: I was a captive in ..., the house of .... I beheld his terrifying splendour .......
I saw Namtar, the vizier of the underworld, who fashions the visceral omens; a man stood before him, while he held the hair of his head in his left hand, and wielded a dagger in his right ....
Namtartu, his wife, had the head of a cherub, (her) hands and feet being human. Death had the head of a dragon, his hands were human, his feet ....
The Evil Genie had a human head and hands, was crowned with a tiara and had the feet of an eagle. With his left foot he was trampling on a crocodile. Alluhappu had a lion's head, his four hands and feet were (like) those of human beings.
The Upholder of Evil had the head of a bird, his wings were spread out and he flew here and there; (his) hands and feet were human. Humuṭ-tabal, the ferryman of the underworld, had an Anzû head, his four hands and feet ....
The Ghost had an ox's head, his four hands and feet were (like) those of human beings. The Evil Spirit had a lion's head, (his) hands and feet were those of Anzû. Šulak was a lion, standing constantly on his hind legs.
The Oath had a goat's head, (his) hands and feet were human. Nedu, the porter of the underworld, had a lion's head, and human hands, his feet were those of a bird. Total Evil had two heads, one was the head of a lion, the second was the head of ....
Muhra had three feet, the two front ones were those of a bird, the rear one was that of a bull. He had fearsomeness and luminous splendour. Of two gods I did not know the names — one had the head, hands, and feet of Anzû, in his left hand .......
The other had a man's head, he was crowned with a tiara, carried in his right hand a mace, in his left hand, before him, ....... In all, fifteen gods were present. I saw them and saluted them in prayer.
There was a man, his body black as pitch, his face resembling that of Anzû; he was clad in red armour. In his left hand he carried a bow, in his right hand he wielded a dagger, while he trampled on a snake with his left foot.
When I raised my eyes, (I saw) the valiant Nergal seated on a regal throne, apparelled with the royal tiara; with both hands he grasped two grim maces, each with two ... heads.
...... were heaped upon them. Lightning was flashing in ... his arms, the Anunnaki, the great gods, knelt to his right and left ....
The nether world was full of terror; a mighty silence lay before the crown prince .... He took me by my forelock and pulled me in front of him.
I looked at him and my bones shivered! His grimly luminescent splendour overwhelmed me, I kissed the feet of his great divinity and knelt down. Then I stood up, while he looked at me, shaking his head.
He raised his voice, crying out like a howling storm in fury against me and drawing toward me the sceptre, which is so fitting to his godhead, and which is as dreadful as a viper, to kill me.
Išum, his adviser, the intercessor, who spares life, who loves truth, howewer, said thus: " Do not kill the man, O king of the wide underworld!
Let him go, and may the peoples of all the lands always hear your glorification!" He made the heart of the all-powerful, the almighty one who binds the evil, as calm as pure well water, (and)
Nergal (relented), saying thus: " Why did you insult my beloved wife, the queen of the nether world?
" By her high command, which cannot be changed, may Bibbu, the hangman of the underworld, turn you over to the porter, Lugalsula, that he may let you out of the gate of Ištar and Aya.
" Do not forget or neglect me! Then I will not pass a verdict of annihilation on you. (But) on the command of Šamaš, may distress, acts of violence and rebellion together blow you down so that, by their oppressive clamour, sleep may not come to you.
" This corpse which (lies) buried in the underworld, is that of the proud shepherd who fulfilled the wishes of my father Aššur, the king of the gods;
" The king who from east and west made all the lands be looked upon as booty, who ruled everything;
" For whom Aššur, at the beginning of his office as high priest, decreed the building of the holy Akitu House of the plain, surrounded by a garden of abundance, the likeness of Mount Lebanon, ...... for ever and ever;
" Whose body Yabru, Humban and Naprušu protect, whose progeny they keep healthy, and whose army and camp they rescued so that no charioteer could come near him in battle.
" He is your father, the eminent one, experienced in matters, wide of understanding, comprehensive in the seat of ordaining fate, who scanned the plans of the mainstay of the earth.
" Who(ever of you) may have closed his ear to his speech, tasted the forbidden, trampled on the consecrated — the luminous splendour of his terrifying majesty will throw you down instantly, until (you are but) wind!
" May this word be set like a thorn in your heart! Go forth to the upper world until I think of you!", he said to me.
I woke up, and like a man who has let blood, who roams alone in a reed thicket, whom a runner catches up with, so that his heart pounds,
or like a just matured young boar, who has mounted on his mate, and whose innards inflate so that he gives out wind from his mouth and backside,
he became inflamed with lamentation and called out, " Woe, my heart!" He flew into the road like an arrow, scooped up into his mouth the dust from street and square, continually letting out terrified shriek, " Woe is me!",
He cried " Why have you decreed this for me?", and in his pain he praised before the peoples of Assyria the mighty deeds of Nergal and Ereškigal, who had come to the aid of the prince.
But also that scribe, who previously had accepted bribes, who occupied the post of his father, with the wise understanding which Ea had given him,
he took the words of praise to heart and spoke to himself: " So that the (curses of) the treaty may not come near me to do (me) evil, and may not threaten me,
let me always carry out my actions as Nergal has ordered!" He went and repeated it to the palace, saying: " Let this be my expiation!"

O Nabû, to avoid sin, O son of Bel, to avoid guilt, in view of the culpable behaviour of my fathers and brothers, who neglected and disregarded ...,
I have yearned for Ezida, the lofty ground, the temple of our trust; I have longed for Ezida, to behold the threshold of delight.
In my childhood, I longed for the Assembly, to sit in the tablet house.
I ... the offerings of the precious temple of Nabû; I constantly think of its fine things; the fire of Ezida burns my heart.
I have received wealth, precociously I achieved (my) goal; (but) old age has confined me to my bed before my time.
I have become finished through pain, as if I did not fear your godhead; I weep (because) I did not experience the beauty of my life.
I have become smaller than the small, lower than the low; my hands are stretched out even to the destitute one, who seeks out my door.
I have prayed to slave and slave-girl, whom I equal in the scales. I have run into an adversary, a sorceress; she has swilled water over me.
I am cut off from my city, the enemies of my dynasty surround me. Constant grief and ill health bring feebleness to me.
I constantly cry out to distant gods, raising my hand in obedience to my goddess. I go around and around in circles; (my) fever ......
I do not see ... ...; death eludes me like precious electrum.
I repeatedly ascend the roof in order to fall down, but my life is too precious, it turns me back.
I give heart to myself, but what (heart) have I got to give? I make up my mind, but what (mind) have I got to make up?
O Nabû, where is your forgiveness, O son of Bel, where are your directions? Where is your pleasant breeze which wafts and goes over the weak ones (devoted) to you?
Lord, when in my boyhood was there darkness? Šamaš lights up over the land, but for me ........ Prosperity rains on the people, but on me rains poison and gall.
My life is finished; Šiddukišarra, where can I go? I have reached the gate of death; Nabû, why have you forsaken me?
Do not abandon me, my lord, to the assembly where there are many who wish me ill! Do not abandon me, O Muduggasa, to the hands of ... my sorceress!
I am one in a weak condition, who fears you; do not let me come to shame in the assembly! I am one who guards truth; do not destroy the truth which I have guarded!
May the lone one who has called to you, lord, not die! Nabû, seize the hand of the destitute one, who craves your divinity!
Save the life of the weak one, whom my ill-wishers constricted; me, over whose head the ill-wishing women swilled as water their charms.
In your breath may the one who is as dead live, may his finished life be again.
" I have plundered the Ahlamû women, along with all their goods."
The king listened carefully, speaking with Na'id-šihu.
" Bring the troops back to your land, Na'id-šihu! They should not go up into the mountains! How will we feed (them)? They will want to eat! They will drink wine until they are drunk!
" Let them bring to me the booty captured by your bow. May the enemy not lure them up into the mountains!"
" I will kill the staff bearer, you can rely on it! I will slaughter the team commanders!"
The town is captured. They have brought the great šihu down on their shoulders.

The ' base of the throne' is overturned .......
If the top of the right surface of the ' finger' is split: defeat of my army. Revolt of my army. My army will not achieve its enterprise.
If the top of the ' finger' is atrophied: the enemy will attack the vanguard of my army.
An attack will be assigned to the king.
The ' increment' is normal. If the upper part extends beyond the surface of the right lung: devastation of the steppe, loss of cattle.
If the middle ' finger' of the lung is overturned and is located in the place of the ' treasure' of the right lung: a country dweller will enter the city, a city dweller will move to the country.
An inhabitant of a fortress of yours will deliver the city to the enemy.
Change of dynasty. The owner of the sacrifice will die in his extispicy.
In the sacrifices of the commoner: dispersal of the man's household.

As to the master builders concerning whom the king, my lord, wrote me: " Give junior ones to the magnates, so they can perform their work assignment with their help" —
(out of) my 16 master builders three are with the palace herald, three are working in the centre of the city, and ten are engaged in bricking my work allocation of the city wall. (This makes) a total of 16 master builders engaged in work.
As for their junior sons, they are apprentices, incapable of doing any (serious) work; it is not within their understanding. They just carry chests after them.
I said: " The master builders have work to do, I cannot give away any of them." I have (already) given six master builders to the work assignment of the centre of the city and the palace herald, and my own work is a great burden on me.

He told her: ' Do not do the work; leave it until the day ....... I am going to gather them. Filling ...... they pour ...; I am going to ... and pour oil upon their heads.'"
These were the words that he spoke in my presence. I asked him: " Did you not open your mouth and speak with him?" He said ... as follows:

In all 30,000 from Na'di-ilu.
All told, I have given out 1 50,000 bricks; but I have omitted the bricks of the royal village managers about which the king, my lord, wrote me.
The king, my lord, knows that the eunuchs and the royal entourage from whom I have been taking the bricks which I have given to the magnates are going to petition the king.

The Palace should hold back the merchant Atarham (who) is in Habruri.
Earlier, before my time, he used to go to Hargu and collect his money ... there. (When) they made ... there, I arrested him, saying:
" Did not the crown prince, our lord, rule like this: ' Nobody shall put bought men up for sale in a trade colony?' Why then have you put bought men up for sale at one mina each?"

To the Palace Herald, my lord: your servant Urda-Sin.
The Cimmerian (king) has departed from Mannea this ... and entered Urarṭu. He is ... in Hu'diadae; Sarduri is ... in Ṭurušpâ.
The messenger of the governor of Waisi has gone to Urzana for help, saying: " Let your troops come to (aid) the people of Pulia and Suriana."
All of Urarṭu is extremely frightened. They are assembling troops, saying: " Perhaps we can attack him, once there is more snow."
As to this booty which they said he has taken, they do say that of the district of Arhi, .........
To the king, my lord: your servant Gabbu-ana-Aššur.
As to the people of Arzâ about whom the king, my lord, wrote me: " I have given you the people entered on the writing-board, the cohort which I formed; these are at your disposal. However, give Arzâ the rest of the people whose (names) I did not write in the writing-board" —
There are no people not on the writing-board at my disposal! In fact, from the people in the writing-board whom the king, my lord, gave me, x are at his disposal!
When the king's messenger came with me to Kurbail
After this, (others) disappeared from the temple and came to me.
Why does the king, my lord, pay attention to groundless allegations? Only those people whom the king, my lord, organized and gave me are in my service. There are no people not on the writing-board (in my service).
To the king, my lord: your servant Gabbu-ana-Aššur.
All the straw in my country is reserved for Dur-Šarruken, and my recruitment officers are now running after me (because) there is no straw for the pack animals.
Now, what are the king my lord's instructions?
To the king, my lord: your servant Gabbu-ana-Aššur.
As to the orders that the king, my lord, gave me concerning the watch of the Urarṭian, ever since I entered Kurbail my messengers have been going back and forth to Nabû-le'i, Aššur-belu-uda''an and Aššur-reṣuwa.
We have not gotten a whiff of anybody or anything. Everybody is doing his work, there is no hostility at all.
We keep hearing as follows: " The Urarṭian has not come out of Ṭurušpâ." Nevertheless, we are keeping the watch about which the king, my lord, gave me orders — we are not negligent.
I arrived in Kurbail on the 16th day of Tammuz (IV), and am sending (this) letter to the king, my lord, on the 20th of Ab (V).
To the king, my lord: your servant Gabbu-ana-Aššur.
Whatever reed there is in our country, the royal bodyguard is ... ing over it.
Let them leave me the booty of the (depot) tower. There are no reeds for my tower.
To the king, my lord: your servant Gabbu-ana-Aššur.
Stone thresholds and bull colossi are imposed upon me, but the people of the country totally refuse to go forth to my work, saying: " Are we your men?"
They do not listen to me — am I ...?
These (people) unanimously and categorically disobey me in every possible way.
To the king, my lord: your servant Ša-Aššur-dubbu. The best of health to the king, my lord!
The forts and the land of the king, my lord, are well.
I sent two eunuchs of mine with six soldiers and a seal(ed order) for the deserters in Penzâ; they went off with two cohort commanders and had the men brought down.
They had dinner there; the brother of the Šubrian (king) too dined with them there.
They set out together and were on their way home, when the Šubrians attacked them from an ambush and captured my two eunuchs and the six soldiers. Both of my cohort commanders escaped.
I wrote him: " Release the soldiers!" but he said: " I will inquire (into the matter); if they are in my country, I shall give them back."
I set out on their trail personally, but they had (already) taken the soldiers up to his fort.
The king, my lord, should send word that the prefects of the royal Taziru and Itu'u (troops) holding (fields) here should come and stand guard with me, until those beams are brought out.
The king, my lord, knows that my men are working in Dur-Šarruken and I have only cavalrymen at my disposal.
To the king, my lord: your servant Aššur-reṣuwa. Good health to the king, my lord!
As regards Naragê, the chief tailor about whom I wrote to the king, my lord: " He and 20 of his fellow eunuchs who conspired against the king have been arrested" —
the king of Urarṭu has now entered Ṭurušpâ and questioned them. They have dragged forth and killed the rest of the people involved in the plot — 100 men, including the eunuchs and the bearded courtiers.
Urṣenê, the deputy commander-in-chief, brother of Abliuqnu, was likewise arrested in Ṭurušpâ. When Abliuqnu came to Ṭurušpâ, he (i.e. the king) questioned him and this brother of his. No sword was drawn; they let them go.
As to Iṣiye about whom the king, my lord, wrote me, nobody knows where he is; I keep inquiring, but nobody can tell me whether he is alive or dead.
The messenger whom I send to Ukku never sees any trace of him; he keeps inquiring, but nobody tells him anything. I am now sending (spies) to inquire and investigate, and shall write (again) to the king, my lord.
To the treasurer, my lord: your servant Aššur-reṣuwa. Good health to my lord!
The messenger of the Ukkean who went to Urarṭu has come down to Assyria, and proceeded from Assyria to the land of the Great Shepherd. In Muṣaṣir ......
My lord should know the heart of this matter. I will write to the palace everything that was written in this letter; I am writing to my lord only these ascertained facts.
To the king, my lord: your servant Aššur-reṣuwa. Good health to the king, my lord!
The land of the king is well; the fort is well; may the king my lord be well!

As to the troops in Kumme about whom my lord wrote me, I have moved up some of them, but have not yet got the others under way.
The equipment of Ariye and Arizâ is in order, but they have not yet departed; when they do set out, my messenger will go ahead of them, and then return to me.
My lord knows that the days ......

To the king, my lord: your servant Na'di-ilu. Good health to the king, my lord!
The first 120 horses of Nabû-remanni arrived in Arzuhina on the 27th. They will be there for the 28th and set out (again) on the 29th.
I shall go and bring them across (the river) to Sarê and keep them in Sarê for the 30th, until the later (horses) reach me.
All the same, the horses have been heavily pressed; the foal s should rest out.
To the king, my lord: your servant Na'di-ilu. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to Šimkaya, the axe maker from Damascus whom the king, my lord, wrote me about, I am herewith sending him to the king, my lord, in the charge of my messenger.
To the king, my lord: your servant Na'di-ilu. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to Naṣib-Il about whom the king, my lord, wrote me: " In ......
" Afterwards, he should keep watch over them."
He does not obey me at all and is not assembling them.
Before I visited the king, my lord, he used to enter my court; I sent him on various errands, and he stayed in my presence. Let the king, my lord, write him as follows: " Assemble the whole Bit-Amukani, stay with the chief cupbearer, and do whatever he commands you!"
Let the king, my lord, (also) send a letter to Šarru-emuranni; he should assemble the whole Bit-Amukani and say to them as follows: " Why do you not obey Naṣib-Il regarding the king's work?"
He told me that the men do not obey him.
To the king, my lord: your servant Na'di-ilu. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote me: " The troops of the ......
To the king, my lord: your servant Nashir-Bel. Good health to the king, my lord!
The land of the king is well; the forts of the king are well. The king, my lord, can be glad.
Perhaps the king, my lord, will say: " Any news of the Urarṭian?" He is still over there; nobody has come from there, we haven't heard any news about them yet.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nashir-Bel. Good health to the king, my lord!
The king, my lord, told me the Itu'ean (prefect) should be exempt, so his bow field is exempt from straw and barley (tax).
(As for) the field of the Assyrians, held in tenancy, I have told (them) to ..., but they have not agreed to ...
I have been using old straw for the work but have run out of it. May the king, my lord, do as he deems best.
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-šumu-iqiša.
The emissaries of the Zikirtean (king) are now coming; the messengers of the Urarṭian who had gone to the Zikirtean are coming with them as captives.
I have had money brought up and deposited in the stronghold, (relying) on the word of the Zikirtean, who said: " I shall sell you the horses in Paššate."
Now let it be impressed upon the emissaries, as the emissaries are trying hard to back out of their word, claiming: " We have not heard about (such a promise) by our lord."
The king should ask the second emissary; he knows that he gave the order to the commander-in-chief.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-uṣalla. Good health to the king, my lord!
Three powerful men of the Kummeans have come and had an audience with me and Mar-Issar, the royal bodyguard. Here is what they said to me:
" Our people may go where the king said, but your messenger should take us to the Palace. There is a matter concerning another country we (wish to) discuss in the king's presence. ... ...; we will not tell it to you, nor will we tell it to the royal bodyguard.
" Else if you do not take us to the Palace, sooner or later we shall say to the king:
"' We spoke with the governor and the royal bodyguard, but they did not agree to bring us to the Palace'."
What are the king my lord's orders?
To the king, my lord: your servant Aššur-balti-niši. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to the captives about whom the king, my lord, wrote me, I have brought them (there).
I and the deputy (governor) have entered them from Tahal as far as Kar-Šamaš, and appointed (them).
I have given out provisions for a whole month, by the seah of 8 litres, and half a cup of salt and cress. Everything is fine.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-hamatua. Good health to the king, my lord!
The forts of the king, my lord, are well.
A Mede forwarded me the (attached) letter from the governor, saying: " Let your messenger bring it to the Palace."
I have spoken kindly with the countrymen of the son of Bel-iddina and encouraged them. The son of Bel-iddina (himself) is a criminal and a traitor; he does not obey the king's orders.
I said: " Do your work, each in his house and field, and be glad; you are now subjects of the king."
They are peaceful and do their work. I have brought them out from six forts, saying: " Go! Each one of you should build (a house) in the field and stay there!"
The king my lord's subjects have entered (the forts); the guard will be strong until the governor comes. I am doing everything the king, my lord, ordered him (to do).
The very best of health to the king, my lord! Your servant Hu-Tešub.
As to the news of the Urarṭians concerning which the king, my lord, wrote me: " Write me quickly whatever you have heard" —
(even) when I heard false ..., I wrote to the king, my lord! Now ...... on the ... th of Marchesvan (VIII)
...... the magnates

" If things have gone badly for him, he will be staying in Mannea; if things have gone well for him, he will have attacked the Zikirteans."
This is what I have heard.
To the king, my lord: your servant Aššur-belu-uda''an. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
On the 22nd day, I said: " I'll go and see the eyes of the king, my lord," (when) I met Kakkullanu the royal bodyguard, (who) turned me back from the town A lite, saying: " Go and release your troops: if they do not go, the men will die of hunger!"
..., I gave them 5 months worth of stored grain; I also gave them 1 litre of oil, 1 litre of bread, and 1 litre of cress ....
Later on, I departed ...... to the troops;
they entered ......
lest they starve. They are staying in the environs of the city ...; they cannot depart because of snow.
Now then they are going about and entering the city with Kakkullanu.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote me: " Why is your major-domo not there?" — the ten city lords about whom I spoke with the king, my lord, are extremely fierce; I did write to the king, my lord, in full earnest.
To the king, my lord: your servant Aššur-belu-da''in. Good health to the king, my lord!
The mule stable attendant whom I brought forth in search of the runaway people of the country has brought forth men from my neighbourhood and given them to me. All Halziatbareans have run away in great numbers and are (scattered) all over the countries. The mule stable attendant is desperate, saying: " It is an impasse."
Now Nabû'a, the mule stable attendant who was appointed in charge of the Chaldeans, has brought me 380 persons; a number of them remain in Yasumu and in Bit-Zamani.
Let them send him a letter (telling him) how he is to bring forth the Chaldeans completely, and how he is to assemble the runaway people of the country and bring them to me.
To the king, my lord: your servant Aššur-belu-da''in. Good health to the king, my lord!
The Ušhaeans and Qudaeans about whom the king, my lord, wrote me, have submitted to the king my lord's command; (these) towns which were not submissive in the days of Šamaš-ila'i, the royal bodyguard has now assembled and brought over to me.
I have made peace with them. Those obliged to provide labour have provided it, and those obliged to provide king's men have provided them.
The whole mountain (area) has observed the king's treaty; the king, my lord, can be glad.
Shall I release the troops at my disposal, or should they (continue to) keep the watch?
The Mumaeans are unsubmissive; shall I go and negotiate with them about the king's command? If not, let the king, my lord, tell me what his orders are.
To the king, my lord: your servant Aššur-belu-da''in. Good health to the king, my lord!
The forts and the garrison of the king, my lord, are well.
The work on the fort in the centre of the town .... Two men ......
...... the ... of the king keep the watch. The Chaldeans are building their houses.
On the 20th of Elul (VI) I started working on the bricks.
To the king, my lord: your servant Aššur-dur-paniya. Good health to the king, my lord!
A commander-of-fifty of mine, of the Gurrean (troops) from Meturna, killed the mayor of Meturna. From the moment the expedition came, he did not show up to do work with his fellows but, afraid of his deed, took with him 15 Gurreans and went away to Urarṭu.
(When) they came and reported it to me, I sent Il-dalâ to Šubria, saying: " Go and bring down your servants." He went, but did he bring down his servants?
I sent my messenger back to Il-dalâ, telling him: " This commander-of-fifty and his men! I have hurt the whole mountain (area) and all the passes because of him! Go in pursuit after him!"
Pursuing him, he went to Šubria. The commander-of-fifty and his soldiers entered Marhuha, a fort of the Šubrian (king). Il-dalâ saw him and made a sworn agreement with him: " Come and bring me the seal of the governor and you shall be free."
My commander-of-fifty and 100 Marhuhaean hoplites went after Il-dalâ and attacked him on the road. The servants of the king, my lord, were on their guard; none of them got killed, and they wounded the commander-of-fifty. They turned back and entered Marhuha.
We, who organized the present pursuit of the commander-of-fifty — they did not arrest him and hand him over but took the man away! Once again, they are (only) bringing forth and handing over old subjects of the king, my lord, who have been living there.
To the king, my lord: your servant Aššur-dur-paniya. Good health to the king, my lord!
The Šubrian emissaries came to Šabirešu on the 23rd of Adar (XII).
Perhaps the king, my lord, will say: " Who are they?" (They are) Yata', his man in charge of the towns near the Urarṭian border, and with him Abi-yaqâ, a local inhabitant.
Perhaps the king, my lord, will say: " Why did his brother and his deputy, who at the review said they would come, not come?" They say: " Hu-Tešub is ill; these (people) have come to bargain."
They have written down on clay tablets the king's men and the people of the country who last year, the year before and three years ago ran away from labour duty and military service, ending up there, and have set them as their bargain; they are going to bring (the tablets) and read them to the king, my lord.
Yet the prime men who now escape the king's work and go there — he gives them fields, gardens and houses, settles them in his country, and there they stay.
These emissaries who came to bargain, Hu-Tešub being ill, said: " We will go and see"; they are now coming, but (when) they read the said tablet to the king, my lord, it is not the whole truth.
Eight men, one mule and three donkeys have come with the emissaries.
The king, my lord, told me: " When the emissaries come, Aššur-bessunu should come with them" — if the king, my lord, so orders, he may go and speak with them. Let the king, my lord, write me what his orders are.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-ušabši, (and) Iglî. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
As to the winged hoof about which the king, my lord, wrote me: " Why is it not finished?" —
had it been at the disposal of the Assyrians, we would have retrieved it from them and quickly finished it!
... the Babylonians ... have been retrieving it
I shall bring it to the king, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant Bel-emuranni. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to the rumour about which the king, my lord, wrote me, I have sent out scouts but they have not yet come back.
While waiting for them, I am submitting the king, my lord, this report.
They should give it and bring it to me.
Or if it is not to be ... and there happens to be a man in his company he can dispense with, let them give it to him, and let him bring it.
A cavalryman should be there to guard him.
To the king, my lord: your servant Šarru-emuranni. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote me: " If horses of such size fall into your hands, get them and send them to me!" —
Kumesaean merchants have reviewed (their stock and) together ...
my lord .......
I waited for them, but since they did not come to me, I sent the servants of the king, my lord, to terrorize Kibatki, and they put people to the sword. After this act of terror on Kibatki, they got afraid and wrote to me, and I imposed a deadline upon them.
If they come and bring the horses I shall send them to the king.
I have fetched the king's ....
To the king, my lord: your servant Šarru-emuranni. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Why did you set out early without waiting for the governor of Arrapha?" —
for the governor of Arrapha, the road in question is very slow. He sets out from Zaban, and it takes him three days to get there, while I can make a round-trip to Parsua going this way.
For this very reason I went up to the fort first. Last year, too, I and he ... accordingly ...
... Shall I not leave the horses and free men in the fort, but take the horses and free men with me, go down to Mazamua, and reap the harvest? I am waiting for the king my lord's messenger; what are the king my lord's orders?
Since the king, my lord, said: " The son of Bel-iddina should go with you," let him go with the troops, and let Nabû-hamatua stay here to do the work of the king, my lord, and repair the forts of the king, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant Šarru-emuranni. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote me: " Organize your army and be on the alert! If feasible, take the road to Hirite by ..." —
it is not at all feasible! The terrain is difficult; it lies between the mountains, the waters are constricted and the current is strong, not fit for using either wineskins or keleks. The king, lord, knows that the men cannot swim.
The troops are assembled, and I am going up to Sumbi, making a detour to ..., then descend to Bit-Hamban ......
I could have gone first ... and waited for him, but he left before me and is waiting for me.
Last year the son of Bel-iddina did not go with me to the expedition but kept the best men at home and sent with me young boys only. Now let the king, my lord, send me a mule stable attendant to make him come forth and go with me.
Otherwise, he will (again) back off, fall away, keep alert grudgingly, and certainly not go with me, but will only send young boys with me, keeping the best men at home.
To the king, my lord: your servant Šarru-emuranni. Good health to the king, my lord!
I am not the son of the city lord of Qunbuna; I am a house-born slave, a servant of the king, my lord! The king, my lord, appointed me in Qunbuna; I tell everything that I see and hear to the king, my lord, I do not conceal anything from the king, my lord.
As to the king my lord's subjects who came to Arzizi from Carchemish, about whom I wrote to the Palace, I have now had them arrested and am herewith handing them over to the king, my lord. From this act, it should be understood in the Palace that I speak earnestly with the king.
Now, Dadâ the Arzizean (has said to me): " Why have you slandered me in the Palace?"
Dadâ does not have a lawsuit against me; there is nothing belonging to him in my possession. He has now gone to the Palace in order to litigate against me; let the king, my lord, investigate whether there is anything belonging to him in my possession.
His messengers constantly go back and forth to the city ... early in the morning;
...... of the people of my country ......
the people of my country .......
To the king, my lord: your servant Šarru-emuranni. Good health to the king, my lord!
The governor of Arzuhina ......
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-issiya. Good health to the king, my lord!
I sent two cavalry cohort commanders to Sanha and Ulušia to the king's subjects who are there. They went and saw them: the equipment (they had received) there and the barley rations specified in their tablet were there.
They warned them, and their guard is very strong. The king, my lord, can be glad.
The king, my lord, knows that Kubaba-ila'i masters the language. I sent him to Tikriš, and he gave us this detailed report. We are herewith sending it to the king, my lord.
All the time I have been encamped on the Mannean border, the son of the widow has been encamped opposite me on his side of the border.
The very day that Nergal-belu-uṣur came here ordering me to depart and I entered the Mannean territory, I sent my ' third man' to him, saying: " Set out!" He said he was sick. I said: " Let your son come!" He said: " He is sick too; I shall send my brother with my troops."
I sent the ' third man,' but he (i.e., this brother) has not yet showed up. The rest of the troops of the city lords are with me.
To the king, my lord: your servant Zabayu, the commander of the fort Appina. Good health to the king, my lord!
The fort and the servants of the king, my lord, are well.
The eunuch who is overseer of the household of Suitkâ the city lord, has fled and come to Appina. Deserters ......
I sent ... to the Palace on the 1st of Marchesvan (VIII); a deserter is (coming) with him. The messengers accompanying him have come, but up to now he himself has not come.
To the king, my lord: your servant Aššur-reṣuwa. Good health to the king, my lord!
3,000 foot soldiers, their prefects, and the commanders of the kallāpu troops of Setini, the governor opposite me, have set out towards Muṣaṣir and crossed the Black River. All the pack animals of Setini are with him.
The troops of Sunâ, the governor opposite Ukku, have also set out towards Muṣaṣir.
I have heard that the king is in Waisi; he will be going but has not yet departed.
To the king, my lord: your servant Aššur-reṣuwa. Good health to the king, my lord!
The Mannean has attacked the Urarṭian cities in the district along the lake shore but has left and gone up (the mountains).
Abaluqunu, the governor of Muṣaṣir, and Ṭunbaun, the governor of Kar-siparri, have gone to the Mannean border, to guard (it).
The Urarṭian is in Ṭuruṣpâ, making his sacrifices. All the governors are with him.
To the king, my lord: your servant Šarru-emuranni. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to the wine about which the king, my lord, wrote me: " Set aside 200 homers for the garrison!" — I have set aside as much of it as the king, my lord, wrote.
As to Kubaba-satar about whom the king, my lord, wrote me: " Speak nicely with him!" —
my mouth is closed. As the king, my lord, wrote me, I shall speak nicely with him ......
He will stay in my presence.
I have now sent (word), and I shall find an interpreter in ..., acquire him for the king, my lord, and send him.
As to the city lords about whom the king, my lord, wrote me: " If they come to you, get them and send them to me!" — may the gods of the king make (that happen)!
Citizens of Babylon have come to (visit) the king, my lord. Previously, when the king, my lord, established the debt-remission, he released many people from their possession. The king, my lord, should ... the matter and let them be informed so they become scared of ... deportation.
To the king, my lord: your servant Šamaš-belu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to the express service about which the king, my lord, wrote me through Arbailayu: " Why isn't there any express service?" —
When he came to me with the royal bodyguard Ubru-Harran, I harnessed before their coming two mules in Arzuhina for the use of Ubru-Harran. He took them to Arrapha, harnessed two mules for the use of Arbailayu, and went on to Mazamua.
Let the king, my lord, ask whether I did not station a team of mules in Dur-Taliti and another one in Tagalagi! When he departed from Arzuhina, there were two mules for his use from one express-station to another, as far as Arrakdi.
As he now came, (going) to where the king, my lord, had sent him, I harnessed two mules in Arzuhina for his use as far as Dur-Taliti (...).
The king, my lord, knows that Arzuhina is situated at a crossroads; the stage from Arzuhina to Arrakdi is a strain for the animals. The king, my lord, should give orders that a mule-express be stationed in Dur-Atanate, so we can strengthen each other.
As to the criminals about whom the king, my lord, wrote me: " They have fallen upon the menservants of the chief confectioner in Babiti" — I have asked and enquired, but there is nothing, and we have not heard anything.
The king, my lord, wrote me: " If you do not catch the criminals, be sure you will have to pay" —
the criminals of Arrapha (and) of the domain of the palace herald have banded together and are making raids there. I have now moved troops up to keep watch; if they catch them, they will bring them to the king, my lord.
For now I am sending to the king, my lord, the criminals of the house of the sartinnu who fell (into my hands) near Arzuhina.
A tablet of Urzana to the palace herald. Good health to you!
As to what you wrote me: " Is the king of Urarṭu on his way (there) with assembled troops? Where is he staying?" —
the governor of Waisi and the governor next to the Ukkean have come and are doing service in the temple. They say:
" The king is on his way; he is staying in Waisi, and further governors are coming to Muṣaṣir to do the service."
As to what you wrote me: " Nobody may take part in the service without the king's permission" —
when the king of Assyria came here, could I hold him back? He did what he did. So how could I hold back this one!
To the king, my lord: your servant Upaq-Šamaš. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to the guard with the augurs, about whom the king, my lord, wrote me: " He should be tried in your presence, and he must give back whatever he took from the augurs" —

Now, I have kept the reserve guard in their service, as the king, my lord, commanded; the other one has gone back to his garrison.
To the king, my lord: your servant Abat-šarri-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to the Chaldean Nabû-ereš about whom the king, my lord, wrote me: " He should be watched secretly" —

To the king, my lord: your servant Nashir-Bel. Good health to the king, my lord!
The land of the king is well; the forts are well. The king, my lord, can be glad.
As to the news of the Urarṭians, the spies I sent to reconnoiter have informed me as follows:
" The governor opposite us is keeping watch with the deputy governor in the city Harda, opposite the Vizier; levied troops are positioned town by town in battle array as far as Ṭurušpâ.
" A messenger of Argisti has come by, saying: ' As to the work I ordered you to do, don't do it! Feed your horses until I send you a messenger.'"
I sent the Itu'eans with the village inspector for the logs which were held back in Eziat, and he got them moved through by fighting. The deputy of their village inspector and nine of his soldiers were struck down by a bow; two of them died. They wounded three of their soldiers. This was their report.
The Itu'eans of the Palace at my disposal have returned from the Euphrates; they did not go with the Vizier. I have sent for them, but (men) of one or two houses only have come out of the town. Let the king, my lord, write to the sheikhs; they should bring the king's men out jointly, to keep watch with me in Laruba, until we have collected the harvest.
To the king, my lord: your servant Ašipâ. The best of health to the king, my lord!

As to the news of Zaba-iqiša, a messenger of the Hubuškian has come and told the sartinnu: " He has been made to depart, and he is on his way to Rusa."
It is a substantiated rumor; I have heard it reported like this many times. I am keeping an eye on him now.
To the king, my lord: your servant Aššur-reṣuwa. Good health to the king, my lord!
Five governors of the Urarṭian have entered Waisi: Setinu, the governor opposite us; Kaqqadanu, the one opposite the Ukkeans; Sakuatâ of Qaniun; Siplia of Alzi; Ṭuki of Armiraliu: these are their names.
They have entered Waisi with three unit commanders. Now, after their (arrival), they have raised the levies of the country, and are keeping the army in readiness.
The king has moved out of Ṭurušpâ and gone to Wa zaun.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote me: " Send out scouts!" — I have sent them twice: the first have come back and told me these things; the others have not yet come out.
As to the men from Muṣaṣir whom the king summoned, they are in Sihana, on the plain. Shall we send word and have them brought here, or should they stay in the plain?

He has not obeyed the king's order though, and has not paid his debt to me; from the moment I appealed to the king, my lord, he has been killing and robbing the king my lord's servants wherever he sees them, laying waste the king's roads.
I cannot leave my house; he is plotting to kill me. I am now on my way to the king, my lord ......

There are x door-beams, each 12 cubits (6 m) long, a ' bone' (c. 32 cm) wide and a ' palm' (c. 8 cm) thick; they are of fir tree and much too thin. I have tried them out here but rejected them.
Had they been of cedar, I would already have cut them into shape and installed them.
Now, what are the king my lord's orders? If the king orders that they should use them, let the king, my lord, write specifically whether we should use them whole or whether we should cut them in two, and I will duly comply and give them over to the accounting of the palace superintendent.
I have finished the work, and will be waiting for the men of the officers of the magnates, until they come and I can check and give (it) to them.

But the Kummean scouts who went from Kumme for hire have not yet returned but are still there! The king, my lord, should inquire and investigate: maybe they are getting deported with those (other Kummeans).

I could not let the king my lord hear the words about the eclipse from my mouth. Now in compensation I send a written report to the king my lord.
The evil of an eclipse affects the one identified by the month, the one identified by the day, the one identified by the watch, the one identified by the beginning, where (the eclipse) begins and where the moon pulls off its eclipse and drops it; these (people) receive its evil.
Sivan (III) means the Westland, and a decision is given for Ur. The evil of the 14th day, as is said, the 14th day means Elam. The beginning, where (the eclipse) began, we do not know. (The moon) pulled the amount of its eclipse to the south and west; that is evil for Elam and the Westland. That it became clear from the east and north, is good for Subartu and Akkad. That it covered all of (the moon), is a sign for all lands. The right side of the moon means Akkad, the left side of the moon means Elam, the upper part of the moon means the Westland, the lower part of the moon means Subartu.
Because of the evening watch ...... which came out ...
which covered all of it ......
and everything not ......
the Šarrabu (people) will say ......
the people of the land must not hear .......
Let the chief exorcist do what he deems best ...... and let the king again remove one prince among the nobles of the Chaldeans or Arameans or ... from his office. These will receive (the consequences) of the sign, and the king my lord can be happy.
In the eclipse of the moon Jupiter stood there: well-being for the king, a famous important person will die in his stead. The king should have much trust in this omen. Until someone speaks a (message of) well-being to the king, how can the king trust? The king of the gods of heaven and earth sent a (message of) well-being to the king my lord.
Maybe the king will say: " The king of the gods sent me a (message of) well-being; why then did you write of the Šarrabu (people) and of a prince?" I say as follows: Let the king be concerned about his work and be set to his work, and let the king my lord become happy. May Bel and Nabû give all lands as substitute for the king my lord.
The king gave order to me: " Keep watch for me, and whatever you know tell me." Now I have written to the king whatever appears correct and propitious to me (and) what is good to the king my lord. Let them read the text two or three times before the king so that the king can penetrate the words. Let the king discern that I wrote true words to the king my lord.
From Munnabitu.
A sign which is unfavorable for the king is favorable for the land; a sign which is favorable for the land is unfavorable for the king.
The king will say, " From what shall I see (that)?"
If Regulus comes close to the front of the moon and stands there: the days of the ruler will come to an end; a confusing word will be solved in the land; for the land, favorable.
If Regulus comes close to the top of the moon and stands there: the king will live for many days; the land will not prosper ...... bad.

From Raši-ilu the older, servant of the king.
If in Marchesvan (VIII) Adad thunders, the day becomes cloudy, it rains, a rainbow stretches, lightning flashes: a famous important person will fall.
The lord of kings must not say as follows: " When a sign came, why did you not write?" —
I wrote a report, but when I gave it to the eunuchs, they did not ... me.
" A famous important person," as it says, does not apply to them; it ... against someone else.

If Libra is dark: for three years locusts will attack and devour the harvest of the land, variant: locusts will devour the land; the land will have to eat a reduced harvest; three years ...
— Mars stands in Scorpius; this is its interpretation:
If the Plough star comes close to Scorpius: the ruler will die from a sting of a scorpion, variant: he will be seized in his palace; after him, his son will not take the throne; the mind of the land will change, the land will get another lord and the dwelling of the land will not become stable; lamentation of the great gods for the land. — Mars stands in Scorpius.
If Jupiter reaches and passes Regulus, and gets ahead of it, (and if) afterwards Regulus, which Jupiter had passed and got ahead of, reaches and passes Jupiter, moving to its setting: there will be rivalry; someone will rise and seize the throne, variant: the land will have worries.
All the signs which have come concern the land of Akkad and its nobles; any evil in them will not come close to the king my lord. An eclipse of the moon and sun in Sivan (III) will take place.
These signs are of bad fortune for Akkad, for the kings of the Westland and of Akkad; and now, in this month of Kislev (IX), an eclipse will take place. Kislev (IX) is the month of ..., and Jupiter will stand in its eclipse; well-being for the king my lord.
Let the king do this, (and) whatever Bel-ušezib will write to the king his lord, and I guarantee it to the king my lord:
The nobles of Akkad whom the king your father had appointed, destroyed Babylon and carried off the property of Babylon; therefore, these signs came, indicating evil. Let the troops of the king go and seize them in their palaces, and let him put others in their stead. If the king does not act quickly, the enemy will come and change them.

You were standing in their midst, so I removed them from your presence. I drove them up the mountain and rained (hail)stones and fire of heaven upon then.
I slaughtered your enemies and filled the river with their blood. Let them see (it) and praise me, (knowing) that I am Aššur, lord of the gods.
This is the well-being (placed) before the Image.
This covenant tablet of Aššur enters the king's presence on a cushion. Fragrant oil is sprinkled, sacrifices are made, incense is burnt, and they read it out in the king's presence.
The word of Ištar of Arbela to Esarhaddon, king of Assyria:
Come, gods, my fathers and brothers, enter into the covenant ......
She placed a slice of ... on the terrace and gave them water from a cooler to drink; she filled a flagon of one seah with water from a cooler and gave it to them with the words:
" In your hearts you say, ' Ištar is slight,' and you will go to your cities and districts, eat (your) bread and forget this covenant.
" (But when) you drink from this water, you will remember me and keep this covenant which I have made on behalf of Esarhaddon."
The word of Ištar of Arbela to Esarhaddon, king of Assyria:
As if I did not do or give you anything!
Did I not bend the four doorjambs of Assyria, and did I not give them to you? Did I not vanquish your enemy? Did I not collect your haters and foes like butterflies?
As for you, what have you given to me?
There is no food for my banquet, as if there were no temple; I am deprived of my food, I am deprived of my cup! I am waiting for them, I have cast my eye upon them.
Verily, establish a seah of bowl food and a one-seah flagon of sweet beer! Let me take and put in my mouth vegetables and soup, let me fill the cup and drink from it, let me restore my charms!
let me lift ......
let me go ......
I went up ......
and arranged a feast ....
When I was there, they said: " We know that you are Ištar of Arbela."
I set out for Assyria to see your success, to tread the mountains with my feet, and to speak about Esarhaddon.
Now rejoice, Esarhaddon! I have bent the four doorjambs of Assyria and given them to you; I have vanquished your enemy. The mood of the people who stand with you has been turned upside down.
From this you shall see that I am Ištar of Arbela.
As soon as the traitors have been dragged forth, ' the ones at the right and left side' shall stand there to bear the punishment.
(As for) those courtiers and palace personnel who rebelled against you, I have surrounded them and impaled them by their teeth.
La-dagil-ili, a prophet of Arbela, prophesied (this) when ...... Ištar .......
The prophetess Mullissu-kabtat (has said):
" It is the word of Queen Mullissu: Fear not, Assurbanipal!
" Until I have done and given to you what I promised, until you rule as king over the sons of the bearded courtiers and the successors of the eunuchs, I will look after you in the Palace of Succession; your father shall gird the diadem ....
" The ... kings of the lands shall say to one another: ' Come, let us go to Assurbanipal! The king has witnesses! Whatever the gods decreed for our fathers and forefathers, let him now arbitrate between us.'
" Mullissu has said: You shall rule over the kings of the lands; you shall show them their frontiers and set the courses they take.
" Secondly, let me tell you: I will finish the land of Gomer like (I finished) Elam.
"... I will break the thorn, I will pluck the bramble into a tuft of wool, I will turn the wasps into a squash.
" Like a centipede, like a ...! You say, ' What does it mean, like a centipede, like a ...?' Like a centipede I will enter Egypt, like a ... I will come out.
" You whose mother is Mullissu, have no fear! You whose nurse is the Lady of Arbela, have no fear!
" I will carry you on my hip like a nurse, I will put you between my breasts (like) a pomegranate. At night I will stay awake and guard you; in the daytime I will give you milk; at dawn I will play ' watch, watch your ...' with you. As for you, have no fear, my calf, whom I (have) rear(ed)."

Like a skilled pilot I will steer the ship into a good port. The future shall be like the past; I will go around you and protect you.
The watch over the lands is very strong. Sixty gods are standing at my right side, sixty gods at my left.

I am the Lady of Arbela. Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, fear not!
I will annihilate whatever enemies you have. As for you, stay in your palace; I will reconcile Assyria with you. I will protect you by day and by dawn and consolidate your crown.
Like a winged bird over its young I will twitter over you and go in circles around you. Like a beautiful (lion) cub I will run about in your palace and sniff out your enemies.
I will keep you safe in your palace; I will make you overcome anxiety and trembling. Your son and grandson shall rule as kings before Ninurta.
I will abolish the frontiers of all the lands and give them to you.
Mankind is deceitful; I am one who says and does. I will sniff out, catch and give you the ' noisy daughter.'
As for you, praise me! Gather into your innards these words of mine from Arbela:
The gods of Esaggil languish in the ' steppe' of mixed evil. Quickly let two burnt offerings be sent out to their presence, and let them go and announce your well-being!
From the mouth of La-dagil-ili of Arbela.

Who (then) is the lone man? Who is the wronged man? Have no fear! Well sheltered is Esarhaddon, king of Assyria.
From the mouth of the woman Urkittu-šarrat of Calah.
Esarhaddon, have no fear! I will put Assyria in order and reconcile the angry gods with Assyria.
I will pull away the cover of your enemies and shed the blood of my king's enemies. I will protect my king; I will bring enemies in neck stocks and vassals with tribute before his feet.
I am your father and mother. I raised you between my wings; I will see your success.

O protege of Mullissu, ... of the Lady of Arbela!
They are the strongest among the gods; they love and keep sending their love to Assurbanipal, the creation of their hands. They give him heart for the sake of his life:
I roam the desert desiring your life. I cross over rivers and oceans, I traverse mountains and mountain chains, I cross over all rivers. Droughts and showers consume me and affect my beautiful figure. I am worn out, my body is exhausted for your sake.
I have ordained life for you in the assembly of all the gods. My arms are strong, they shall not forsake you before the gods. My shoulders are alert, they will keep carrying you.
I keep demanding life for you with my lips; ... your life; you shall increase life.
O favourite of Nabû, may your lips rejoice! I keep speaking good words about you in the assembly of all the gods; I roam the desert desiring your life.
In woe I will rise and slaughter your enemy; your ... will ... and return to his country.
May Mullissu and the Lady of Arbela keep Assurbanipal, the creation of their hands, alive for ever!

Nisan 18, eponymy of Bel-šadû'a, governor of Tyre (650).
The king appointed Ṣillaya ... with the sons of Eṭeru of the Sealand, and they have seized ..., saying: " It is the king's order: Give us the ... which ... gave to your fathers as a nishu payment!"
The Babylonians and the(ir) commandant Ubaru (said to them): " There is no such order of the king! Last year, in Calah, when you appealed to the king for the collection of old debts (incurred) while Babylon was still intact, the king lost his temper with you, (shouting): ' What is there in Babylon (to collect)? The city was in ruins, and I have resettled it and established its freedom!' This was the word that came from the mouth of the king, our lord!"
... these ... appealed to the king, saying: " Let them appoint ...... with us," he gave .......
All the gifts of the Babylonians, which the king has redeemed for silver from the moneylenders' house, all the ... s which the king has collected from Elam and Hatti and has cleared for Bel and Zarpanitu, the dead bodies whom the king has revived —
(all this) they are selling off, and are making the broken country which the king my lord restored drift apart from the king.
Ṣillaya does not wish the settling of Babylon. He has incited them ..., but the king my lord is an able and well-informed leader; let him do as he deems best.

May I die as the substitute of the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the lord of kings, my lord!
I have now been kept in confinement for two years and, for fear of the king, my lord, though there have been good and bad portents for me to observe in the sky, I have not dared to report them to the king, my lord.
Now, however, afraid that it might turn into my fault, I have decided to write to the king, my lord.

I fully master my father's profession, the discipline of lamentation; I have studied and chanted the Series. I am competent in ..., ' mouth-washing,' and purification of the palace .... I have examined healthy and sick flesh.
I have read the (astrological omen series) Enūma Anu Enlil ... and made astronomical observations. I have read the (anomaly series) Šumma izbu, the (physiognomical works) Kataduqqû, Alandimmû and Nigdimdimmû, ... and the (terrestrial omen series) Šumma ālu.

Among the ...... apprentices who studied with me in ......, there are ...... who have returned from Elam, scribes, chanters, exorcists, haruspices, and physicians; I shall gather them and give them to the king, my lord.
NN has crossed over from Elam; he fully masters extispicy and is an expert in Enūma Anu Enlil, ancient and Sumerian hermeneutics and the secrets of heaven and earth; he is useful to the king, my lord.
NN, an exorcist, is a refugee from Assyria; he is useful to the king, my lord.

I am a dead body. Let me behold the face of the king, my lord, and die.
To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant Bel-ušezib. May Bel, Nabû and Šamaš bless the king, my lord!
If a star flashes like a torch from the east and sets in the west: the main army of the enemy will fall.
If a flash appears and appears again in the south, makes a circle and again makes a circle, stands there and again stands there, flickers and flickers again, and is scattered: the ruler will capture property and possessions in his expedition.
If the king has written to his army: " Invade Mannea," the whole army should not invade; (only) the cavalry and the professional troops should invade. The Cimmerians who said, " The Manneans are at your disposal, we shall keep aloof" — maybe it was a lie; they are barbarians who recognize no oath sworn by god and no treaty.
The chariots and wagons should stay side by side in the pass, while the cavalry and the professionals should invade and plunder the countryside of Mannea and come back and take up position in the pass. If, after they have repeatedly entered and plundered the open country, the Cimmerians have not advanced against them, the whole army can enter and throw itself against the cities of Mannea.
Bel has ordered the destruction of the Manneans and is for the second time delivering them into the hands of the king, my lord. If on this 15th day the moon is seen with the sun, it will be on account of them, (indicating) that the Cimmerians will keep aloof from them and that the ... will be conquered.
I am writing to the king, my lord, without knowing the exit and entry of that country. The lord of kings should ask an expert of the country, and the king should (then) write to his army as he deems best.
Deserters outnumber fighting men among the enemy — therein lies your advantage. At the entry of the whole army, let patrols make sorties, capture their men in the open country and question them; if the Indareans are keeping away from them, the army can invade and throw itself against the cities.
The king of the gods, Marduk, is reconciled with the king, my lord; whatever the king my lord says, he can do. Sitting on your throne, you will vanquish your enemies, conquer your foes and plunder the land of your enemy.
Bel has said: " Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, is (seated) on the throne like Marduk-šapik-zeri, and (while) he is seated there, I will deliver all the countries into his hands." The king is the lord of ....
The king may happily do as he deems best.
Concerning the solar eclipse about which the king wrote to me: " Will it or will it not take place? Send a definite word!"
An eclipse of the sun, like one of the moon, never escapes me; should it not be clear to me and should I have failed (to observe it), I would not find out about it.
Now since it is the month to watch the sun and the king is in the open country, for that reason I wrote to the king: " The king should pay attention, whether it occurs or not."
" Mars has become visible; why have you not written?" —
Mars was sighted in the month of Ab (V); now it has approached within 2.5 spans (= 3°30') of Libra. As soon as it has come close to it, I shall write its interpretation to the king, my lord.
What was sighted now is Mercury in Capricorn; (the sighting) of Mars ...
To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant Kudurru. May Aššur, Šamaš, Bel and Nabû bless the king of the lands, my lord!
Ever since the day when the king my lord deported me, I have sat in confinement, praying to the king, my lord, every day, (until) Nabû-killanni the chief cupbearer sent a cohort commander to release me.
As I was walking with him, he says to me: " You are an expert in scribal lore? NN tells me you are an expert in scribal lore."
It was the month of Marchesvan (VIII) when Nabû-killanni fetched me, and I ended up standing in the temple of Bel Harran. The cohort commander re-emerged and took me to an upper room into his presence. There was nobody in his presence except the cohort commander, the major-domo, the chamberlain and the chief cupbearer; in addition, the overseer of the city kept entering and leaving his presence.
They tossed me a seat and I sat down, drinking wine until the sun set. Moving my seat closer, he started speaking to me with the quota of the temple of Nusku, saying: " You are an expert in divination?"
he made me love him ......
" I'll tell you this: the king has provided for me, until in anger he placed (me) in your service.
" Go and perform the (following) divination before Šamaš: ' Will the chief eunuch take over the kingship?'"
I washed myself with water in another upper room, donned clean garments and, the cohort commander having brought up for me two skins of oil, performed (the divination) and told him: " He will take over the kingship."
Next day, they libated a jug of wine before ... and Ba nitu, and made merry until the sun was low. From that (day) on he has been telling me: " He will take you back into your father's house, ...... and give you the kingship of all Babylonia."
By the gods of the king, my lord: The extispicy which I performed was but a colossal fraud! (The only thing) I was thinking of (was), " May he not kill me."
Now then I am writing to the king, lest the king my lord hear about it and kill me.

To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant Ninurta-aha-iddin. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May the great gods make the foundation of your offspring as durable as heaven and earth.

Let me read the tablets in the presence of the king, my lord, and let me put down on them whatever is agreeable to the king; whatever is not acceptable to the king, I shall remove from them.
The tablets I am speaking about are worth preserving until far-off days.
To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant Kudurru. May Aššur, Šamaš and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
After the king, my lord, had gone to Egypt and the eclipse took place in Tammuz (IV), there were no men of mine for the life of Assyria among them, (so) he sent (messengers) to every direction. Now then, let the king ask the messengers of their life.
When I acquired the plant of life of the eclipse of Tammuz (IV), it disappeared in the king's presence. I dispatched it to the king, my lord, in the hands of Šumaya son of Kabtiya, in Nisan (I) last year, (yet) up to now the king has given no order to me.
I have sent many sorceresses to the king, my lord; the king may check. Nabû-zera-lišir the nephew of Zakir is an exorcist; he has performed the Bīt rimki, Egalkura and " Undoing-the-Curse" rituals for the commandant Bel-eṭir.
Did the king, my lord, not order me to visit him twice a year?
To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant Zakir. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king of the lands, my lord! May Bel and Nabû keep you alive for long days of happiness and physical well-being, and may they deliver your enemy into your hands!
The moon made an eclipse on the 15th of Tebet (X), in the middle watch. It began in the east and shifted to the west — a decidedly evil portent concerning the king of the Westland and his country.
Its evil is definite; its evil will befall the king of the Westland and his country. If there is an enemy of the king, my lord, in the West, the king, my lord, may do as he pleases; the king, my lord, will capture (him), and the king will defeat him. These are definite words.
You are (a) just (king). Thanks to the just policy that you have adopted, Šamaš and Marduk have delivered (all the lands) from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea to the king, my lord.
From the shore of the sea I have lifted my hand (in supplication) to the king, my lord. You are merciful; may Marduk and Zarpanitu intercede for me before the king, my lord.
To the queen mother, my lady: your servant Aplaya. May Bel and Nabû bless the queen mother, my lady!
Now then I am daily praying to Nabû and Nanaya for the maintenance of the life and the extension of the days of the king of the lands, my lord, and of the queen mother, my lady.
The queen mother, my lady, can be of peaceful mind. A gracious angel (lit. messenger) of Bel and Nabû has gone with the king of the lands, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant Ašaredu. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king of the lands, my lord!
The tablet which the king is using is defective and not whole. Now then I have written and fetched from Babylon an ancient tablet made by King Hammurapi and an inscription from before King Hammurapi.
Let the king ... the ritual according to ...
From Ašaredu the Younger.
Long since I ....... They should believe me.
To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant Ninurta-aha-iddin. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May the great gods make the heart of the king my lord ...
I have set (aside) ... for the king, my lord; let them fetch and consult (the dictionary) Arû = " to lead."
To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant Bel-ušezib. May Bel, Nabû and Šamaš bless the king, my lord!
(If) an eclipse occurs but is not seen in the capital, that eclipse has passed by. The capital is the city where the king resides.
Now there are clouds everywhere; we do not know whether the eclipse took place or not.
Let the lord of kings write to Assur and all the cities, to Babylon, to Nippur, to Uruk and Borsippa; maybe they observed it in these cities. The king should constantly listen.
Many signs of the eclipse came in Adar (XII) and in Nisan (I), and I communicated all of them to the king, my lord; and if they perform the apotropaic ritual of the eclipse ..., will that do any harm? It is advantageous to perform it, the king should not leave it.
The great gods who dwell in the city of the king, my lord, covered the sky and did not show the eclipse, so that the king would know that this eclipse does not concern the king, my lord, and his country. The king can be glad.
" (If) Adad thunders in Nisan (I), the crop will diminish."
To the mother of the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-šuma-lišir. May Šamaš and Marduk show concern for the health of the mother of the king, my lord!
The slave girl in the house of Šamâ who was entrusted to my care — once the ritual of the eclipse becomes timely, it will be performed on her.
The queen mother said: " They should give rams." If it is acceptable to the queen mother, let them appoint that the rams are given to the chief of accounts of the palace.
May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Your servant NN.
As the king last year summoned his scholars, he did not summon me with them, (so) I wrote to the palace: " The apprentices whom the king appointed in my charge have learned Enūma Anu Enlil; what is my fault that the king has not summoned me with his scholars?"
The king said: " Have no fear, I will summon you." But when I departed from there, up to now the king has not summoned me.
Now the king has summoned scribes great and small, but the king has not summoned me, not with the ... nor with the ....
Concerning the hoopoe about which you said: " It has been sent as a message" — and concerning the temple of Marduk, we shall see a good month, and it (the ritual) should be performed; he does not know.
Elul (VI) is a good month.
Also, concerning the ritual of the haruspex, he does not know about the 2nd day; again, it is good. Let it be performed and let us be confident.
Also, if it is feasible, why don't the guards and Perhu keep watch there, on account of a matter like this?
Alternatively, if it is not good to let the men go to the roof of the temple at dawn, some expedient must be formed on account of the bird (and) anything beyond it.
Concerning the roof of the temple of Marduk about which the king, my lord, spoke, it is good to perform (the ritual) there. Elul (VI) is a good month; and the 2nd day is suitable for extispicy. Let it be performed accordingly.
To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant Rašil. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The king, my lord, has reared me from my childhood until the present day, and ten times has the king, my lord, taken my hand and saved my life from my enemies.
You are a merciful king. You have done good to all the four quarters of the earth and placed the plant of life in their nostrils.
Now, ...... are plotting

For 6 years I have been guarding Aššur-etel-šamê-erṣeti-muballissu, and Bel and Nabû have provided good health.
(By) Bel and Nabû ..., your gods: the king, my lord, is merciful. Let the king send a bodyguard with me, so I may go and bring out my brother and retrieve my fortune. Let me go and come back quickly!

Why is Aššur-natkil, the cohort commander of Adin, on his own hook dissolving a contract that the king, my lord, has made?
Two horses (and) tenant farmers cultivated my field; I sent two of my apprentices there, but Aššur-natkil arrested them and threw them into prison. He has destroyed the barley ..., and they have put my apprentices too in ....

To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant Bel-ušezib. May Bel, Nabû and Šamaš bless the king, my lord!
I saw the crescent of the moon but the sun was rising; he may have cleansed it, but it was not to be seen.
Whether it was a crescent, or whether it appeared on the 15th, or whether it will appear on the 16th day, it is an evil portent, and it concerns the Manneans. Wherever an enemy attacks a country, the country will carry this evil portent.
Now the army of the king, my lord, having attacked the Manneans, has captured forts, plundered towns and pillaged the open country. Should it return, it would heap it up and plunder the rest of the country. But should the army of the king, my lord, not go out against the enemy, that would be dangerous.
Last year, when the moon was seen with the sun on the 15th day for 5 (consecutive) months, did Sidon not carry it? Did the city not fall, were its people not chased away? Now, in accordance with this, the cities of the Mannean will be plundered, his people taken in captivity, and he himself will be encircled in his palace until he will be delivered into the hands of the king, my lord.
The king my lord can be very glad indeed. You will defeat your enemy and vanquish your foes, and you will grasp the hand of Bel in Babylon for many years.
" If the moon is not seen but the crescent is seen, there will be hostilities in the land."
The people of the Mannean king will turn against him and become the king's servants.
" (If) the moon and the sun are seen together on the 15th day: a strong enemy will raise his weapons against the land; the enemy will tear down the city gates."
Now then the army of the king, my lord, has raised its weapons against the Mannean and will tear down his royal city. There is nothing in these signs that would concern the king, my lord, and his country.
Now then, four elders of noble descent from Nippur, the nešakku priests of Enlil, are (on a visit) here in Nineveh. The lord of kings should ask them why Šuma-iddin, the governor, has removed the dais of Nippur, an ancient dais built in the distant past, changed its place, and performed an apotropaic ritual on account of it.
NN, the governor's son who is being held (as hostage) here at the feet of ..., has ... smuggled to him four minas of gold and all kinds of Babylonian luxuries, and he is giving them to Sasiya, NN and Ṣillaya.
Maybe they are saying nice things about Šuma-iddin. It should be known to the king, my lord, however, that this very day a conspiracy is being made and planned in the king's presence, right before him, and Šuma-iddin has his hands in it.
Your royal father let the governor of Nippur stay in office for ten years; now in a year three governors have left office.
May the king, my lord, live forever! The Egyptian Šarru-lu-dari, a friend of Bel-eṭir, the governor of HAR, and a friend of Sasiya, may have been induced to join the conspiracy of Šuma-iddin. The king should be wary of all of them.
As to this man who removed (the dais), changed its place, and performed an apotropaic ritual on account it — he (must have) said (to himself): " Let me avert the evil omens from myself, ...... and let them be diverted to the king's palace instead ...."
Now then, whatever has been dropped into the king's ears and whatever the ... have bestowed upon him, let the king's palace be happy and the signs .......
Lugalkursarri, a Sumerian king, ...... of Enlil, has said as follows: " A great king ...... who ...... his mouth, the king in his heart ...." ' Great ...' means the king's face, as it is said.

Why is this governor plotting against the crown while the king, my lord, is searching for the seed of Bit-Yakin, Bit-Amukani, Bit-Dakuri and HAR, all the dynasties which have put up a hundred horses?
The great gods said to Bel: " May it be in your power to exalt and to abase." You are Marduk of the people; Bel destined your glorious ... s (to be) like destinies. Let the king, my lord, act in a way corresponding to Bel: abase the high and exalt the low.

If on the 14th day the moon and sun are seen together: reliable speech; the land will become happy; the gods will remember Akkad favorably; joy will be set up among people; the king will become happy; the cattle of Akkad will lie in the steppe undisturbed.
If the moon and sun are in balance: reliable speech will be placed in the mouth of people; the king will make his throne last long.

Now his son Bel-ahhe-riba — his mother is Borsippan but his grandmother Assyrian, he himself is a Borsippan — is in a leading position among the Borsippans and the nobility of Borsippa, and he is devoted to Assyria, having said: " May (the rule of) the king, my lord, last over me unto the end of days, and may I pull the yoke of Assyria."

A word of the king to Urad-Gula:

Write down and send me what they say even (if) there is no alternative ... how it is performed. And write down and send (this) via NN.

The ' farmer' should perform the apotropaic ritual against evil of any kind; the ' farmer' should (also) perform the penitential psalms for Nergal and the ' hand-lifting' prayer for Nergal. Let them write in the apotropaic ritual and the prayer as follows:
" In the evil of the planet Mars which exceeded its term and appeared in the constellation Aries: may its evil not approach, not come near, not press upon (me), not affect me, my country, the people of my palace and my army!"
Let them write like this in the apotropaic ritual and the ' hand-lifting' prayer.
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Nanaya. The very best of health to the king, my lord! May Ninurta and Gula give happiness and physical well-being to the king, my lord!
The speech that the king, my lord, made to his servants about the former kings who had fallen ill: " How did their servants sit up with them all nights and carry them on litters! How (well) did they keep watch over them!" —
the king, my lord, made a speech about men, and all the alert servants who have remembered their orders died of throbbing heart because of this speech of the king.
Aššur and the great gods bound and handed over to the king these criminals who plotted against (king's) goodness and who, having concluded the king's treaty together with his servants before Aššur and the great gods, broke the treaty. The goodness of the king caught them up.
However, they made all other people hateful in the eyes of the king, smearing them like a tanner with the oil of fish.
The king, my lord, is one who fears the gods. Aššur, Šamaš, Bel and Nabû, who have given you confidence, will not abandon the king and the crown prince, but will secure the rule of the king and the crown prince until far-off days.
The herbs which I am sending to the king are of two kinds; they are called ' long plant' and ' staff of life' and are different from each other. The one which looks like a base of an earring is important and very rare.
Perhaps the king will say: " What are they good for?" They are good for counterspells, and they are good for a woman in lab our.
I am also sending a ' healer.' The ' healer' ... in the bed of .......
Perhaps the king will say: " Is he here?" — I have gone where the king, my lord sent me.
Concerning the bile which he purged upwards and which settled downwards, in the whole medical literature it is said as follows:

To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The charge of the rear palace is well. We are doing (our) work and stay awake (with him) unremittingly, and we pray to the gods.
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
What has not been done in heaven, the king, my lord, has done upon earth and shown us: you have girded a son of yours with headband and entrusted to him the kingship of Assyria; your eldest son you have set to the kingship in Babylon. You have placed the first on your right, the second on your left side!
(When) we saw (this), we blessed the king, our lord, and our hearts were delighted. May Aššur, Šamaš, Nabû, Marduk, and the great gods of heaven and earth let the king my lord, see them (= the princes) prosper! May Aššur, Adad and Šamaš, ten (times) each, determine a good fortune for the king, my lord, and for his sons! May Aššur make your name endure with heaven and earth!
Just as you have prepared a fine career for these sons of yours, prepare likewise a fine career for (the rest) of your numerous sons! Bring them into (your protective) shadow and shelter! May they like grass seed rule over all countries! May you be good to Assyria — may Assyria be good to you!

(But) the Assyrians seeing (this to happen), have let out a sigh of relief and said: " O king, our lord, with the kings, your sons, do a favour for Assyria!"
Now, O king, my lord, the god Aššur has given you (the world) from the rising of the sun to the setting of the sun. Look upon these fine sons of yours and your heart will rejoice. The king, my lord, should banish unpleasant thoughts from his mind; such thoughts (only) make you weak.
(While) you will grow old, joy ...... Arrange the wedding night of your sons, make their hearts delighted!
... god and man .......
I am (but) an old man of the king, my lord; I put my trust in the king, my lord. May I hear about the health of the king, my lord, may my heart be delighted!

They watched the moon; the clouds were dense, and the moon was not seen. The 30th day became ' long.'
I have performed the ritual upon the clothes of the people, as the king instructed me. Now, should the others still be brought out and shall I perform (the ritual) upon them?
Or shall I perform it only upon these? Let the king, my lord, decide what to do and write me.
And concerning those jewels of the (divine) chariot, if they have been brought, they should either be given to me or ......
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The charge of the rear palace is well.
Concerning the substitute king about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me: " I was told that he should sit (on the throne) until the 8 th of Elul (VI); is it ... that we shall perform (the ritual) Bīt salā' mê in the month Tishri (VII)?" — when a substitute king was sitting in the month Marchesvan (VIII), in Sivan (III) ...
We are now waiting for a solar eclipse; if it passes by, the king, my lord, should act in this way.

To the ' farmer,' my lord: your servant Nabû-naṣir. May Nabû and Marduk bless the ' farmer', my lord!
Concerning what the ' farmer,' my lord, wrote yesterday: " I have given orders ......" —
After they had briefed me on (his) health, I went to rest my arms.
In the evening I entered and performed a complicated ritual treatment. We were about to enter upon NN (when we were told): "... is quite well"
I asked them " How did it happen?"
They said: " Yesterday night, on the flank of the evening watch, (as) he examined his flesh, he was frightened. (As) the exorcists entered, he got frightened again. ... he was not frightened, (and when) the day arrived, he was in good shape." Now he is doing very well.
To the ' farmer,' my lord: your servant Urad-Nanaya. The very best of health to the ' farmer,' my lord! May Ninurta and Gula give happiness and physical well-being to the ' farmer,' my lord!
As to the cure of the blotches ......, they should let me enter ...

To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " I am feeling very sad; how did we act that I have become so depressed for this little one of mine?" — had it been curable, you would have given away half of your kingdom to have it cured! But what can we do? O king, my lord, it is something that cannot be done.
And as to what the king, my lord, said to me about the sons, your lords: " The burning question of ' who' is eating me up" — in the month Sivan (III) I wrote to the king, my lord: " Take hold of yourself, prepare for everything!" Did I not write in my ... to the king, my lord?

We are giving silver to the masters who came with me, and they are overlaying the sanctuaries of Ezida as the king, my lord, commanded. Elallu limestone should be acquired and brought for the king, my lord's stand in Esaggil. The shares which I took with me, have been distributed to the delegates of Babylonia by myself and the cohort commander Idri-aha'u.
And since the king, my lord told me to speak with them I said to them as follows: Seven foundation stones of x cubits each will be placed ..., right and left, and a ram will be slaughtered upon them. They will be covered with blood, and placed in the foundations until far-off days."
I continued: " The king, my lord, has now, with the ... of the heavens which is not altered, concluded a treaty with you before the sanctuary, in front of the gods, and has adjured you:
' You shall not change ... my words;
' You shall return to me the ... s and captives who ... and the Assyrians who have fled to your country;

As to the tampons of mar takal-seed about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, those which are (intended) to stop nasal hemorrhage are prepared as follows:

From his childhood till his maturity, my father took care of the father of the crown prince. Steadily he stood in his presence; he shared the ... of his basket with the king, his lord; he experienced the days of misfortune with the king, his lord.
The king, our lord, ...... kindness ......; he dressed him in purple ... and appointed him the chief haruspex. Among the servants of the king ... and the elders of the palace ......
... until the setup ......
of the king, my lord ......
Everything that he had said ...... Šamaš caused to be understood through his (= my father) hands.
(So) he (= the king) said: " My servant has ... ed after me; let me do my servant a favour. The first token of my favour is: I will assign to him the leadership of scholars. My second favour is: As long as he is in Assyria, let him be near me."
Furthermore he said: " If I didn't do him a favour, would it be appropriate in the sight of the gods?"
(So) he did him the (said) favour, and myself, as part of the favour shown to my father, he gave to the crown prince, my lord.
And the crown prince, my lord, drew up a contract (entitling) me to have usufruct of the ' leftovers' of the crown prince, my lord. Now, what have I done wrong in the eyes of the crown prince, my lord?
One haruspex is enjoying (the leftovers), but have I really been all that happy since they withheld my ...? Now the crown prince, my lord, had added (to my misery) by dressing another haruspex in purple (robes); as for my heart, the crown prince, my lord, has broken it.
How can he thus humiliate the servants of the king and the crown prince, the servants of my father's house, (that) they say: " That one, what's his favour?" I (can only) say: " Let the crown prince make me weep, (but) what is your fault?
A foreign ... is being honoured, (while) I, a servant of the king and the crown prince, have been left in darkness! Is the ...... whom the crown prince has honoured, ......, or is he outside or inside the guard duty? I am a servant of the crown prince; my father was the foundation ...... of kingship ......
Moreover, (whereas) Aplaya and Naṣiru have kept in their hands non-canonical tablets and ... s of every possible kind, I have learned (my craft) from my (own) father.
Now, let the crown prince put his servant to a test: I am an expert in extispicy, tablets, writing of reports and things beyond (that). The crown prince, my lord, may treat his servant as he deems best, but why did the crown prince, my lord, thus break my heart?

To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-ahhe-eriba. Good health to the king, my lord. My Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the large field of the Assyrians about which the king, my lord, wrote to me: " It was a very productive field; who is removing the grain?" —
the farmers who seeded the fields do not revere Adad any more; that is why he let a lightning bolt strike down (and devastate the field).
Since the king, my lord, commanded (so), an exorcist should perform the (ritual called) " Purification of the Field," and he should at the same time also perform the (apotropaic ritual called) " Evil of a Stroke of Lightning."
As to what the king, my lord, wrote me: " Visit me the first day I am unoccupied" — may Aššur, Bel and Nabû give the king, my lord, long days and happiness; may they bring your enemies to submission before your feet!
May the goddess DN subdue ......; may she day after day, month after month and year after year present the king, my lord, with rejoicing, pride, joy, jubilation and merry mood.
The driller, whom your royal father shaved, used to enter the ablution chamber, and your royal father put him in charge of the statues as well. Now, he died in Elul (VI). He has left a son (who) is a novice and ' stands with his hair.' Now, if it is acceptable to the king, my lord, let them shave him. The king, my lord, knows that these are the days of the ritual — that is why I am instructing the king, my lord.
The priest of the temple of Uraš is not shaved, either. This is the guard of a priest: in the old times, if the brothers of the priests appointed by your royal fathers went to the temple of Uraš with him, the assistant priest ......
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Is this the truth?" — may Bel and Nabû, your gods, call to account the one who is not honest with the king, his lord! ... recently ......; I was confused. I did not see his ..., (but) perhaps the king, my lord, saw. What can I say?
In any case, I guarantee under oath: it shall be a great success.
If the king, my lord, had not attained his desire and if he had not gone safely and happily where he had to go! Why (is the king) like this?
When the king, my lord, formerly two or three times asked his servant about malformed births or anything at all, did I conceal (anything), be it good or bad, from the king, my lord?
After me ...
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the crown prince's visiting the king, my lord, is it because of the earthquake that he has said: " The crown prince should not go outdoors"?
It is (already) a fortnight today since the earth quaked, the pertinent ritual has been performed twice, and the king, my lord, knows the relevant interpretation. As they say, what has it to do with this? The visit of the crown prince would be perfectly all right now.
...... my lord
...... till you come.
Perhaps there are, on the other side, sign-forms that he does not understand; I will explain to him all that I know. I shall go presently; my brother should know (this).
Now then, let them select a Babylonian writing-board;

As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Have I been purified with (the help of) Urad-Ea and these ......?" — the gods of the king, my lord, know that, verily, the king, my lord, has been purified 10 times over! May the god DN, the lord of the shining ..., give light to the king, my lord, for numerous years.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: "... are being bound to ... speech against me;
the advice ... that they gave, it (or) anything
The king, my lord, is made like a sage; he has understood her counsels, he has spoken out his sins and been purified.
As to what the king, my lord, said: " He who knows this matter should speak out — is it true?" — who could possibly give any kind of counsel to the sun? " He who talks lies and rubbish to the king, his stance is (unsteady as) a storm, and his front is (shifting like) the wind."
She will recover through ....... All is well. The king, my lord, can be glad.

And concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Let all the omens be extracted," — should I at the same time copy the tablet of non-canonical omens of which I spoke? Or should I write them on a secondary tablet? What is it that the king, my lord, orders?
The moon which (just) became visible, portends well-being ....... Let the king, my lord, have a look at the writing-board, I myself shall see whatever (else) there is to it. (The omens are as follows:)

We kept watch on the 29th day; there were clouds, and we did not see the moon. Today, on the 30th, there were clouds again; when they dispersed, we saw the moon. It was (not) like the moon of the 29th day. Three days ....
Perhaps ... ... ...
If the moon at its appearance is ...: the ruler will have no opponent.
The interpretation of the observation of the moon and the sun is as follows:
If the moon is not seen with the sun on the 14th of Tammuz (IV): the king will be shut up in his palace.
If the moon and sun are seen together on the 15th day: a powerful enemy will raise his weapons against the land and destroy the sanctuaries of the great gods.
Furthermore, from the month Nisan (I), the beginning of the previous year, (when) the gods saw each other, until the past month Iyyar (II) they saw each other during the 15th day. The interpretation of these observations is as follows:
If the moon keeps setting while the sun rises: the reign of the king will come to an end, there will be years of struggle and his country will experience severe famine.

May the great gods of heaven and earth give long-lasting days of life to the king, my lord! That the king remembered us and that we have not seen the king (I do not know) for how long today, that is (the sole reason) why we stand in front of the king. To whom else would we be devoted?
To whom indeed has the king done such a favour as to me whom you have appointed to the service of the crown prince, to be his master and to teach him? Could I have forgotten those kind words of the king, my lord? I look forward to seeing the king, my lord, (soon) again.

The king, my lord, would perhaps say: " Why did you not remind (me)?"

Now, let me leave ......; or what is it that the king, my lord, orders?
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the two (patients) in the new palace and concerning Sin-per'u-ukin about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Go and see them" —
now, the king knows that a eunuch took me to the house of Danî, and I performed a ritual for the benefit of his son. His affliction is severe, he is very ill.
Because I have been taking care of him, it is not good to go today. I shall go tomorrow, see them and report their health to the king. I will appoint exorcists to treat them.
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk very greatly bless the king, my lord!
Aššur, the king of the gods, called the name of the king, my lord, to the kingship of Assyria, and Šamaš and Adad, through their reliable extispicy, confirmed the king, my lord, for the kingship of the world.
A good reign — righteous days, years of justice; copious rains, huge floods, a fine rate of exchange! The gods are appeased, there is much fear of god, the temples abound; the great gods of heaven and earth have become exalted in the time of the king, my lord.
The old men dance, the young men sing, the women and girls are merry and rejoice; women are married and provided with earrings; boys and girls are brought forth, the births thrive.
The king, my lord, has revived the one who was guilty and condemned to death; you have released the one who was imprisoned for many years. Those who were sick for many days have got well, the hungry have been sated, the parched have been anointed with oil, the needy have been covered with garments.
Why then must I and Urad-Gula, amidst them, be restless and depressed?
The king, my lord, has now displayed his love for Nineveh to (all) the people, in saying to the (family) heads: " Bring your sons to stay in my entourage!" Urad-Gula is my son; he too should stay with them in the entourage of the king, my lord. We too should, together with all the people, be merry, dance, and bless the king, my lord!
My eyes are fixed on the king, my lord. None of those who serve in the palace like me; there is not a single friend of mine among them to whom I could give a present, and who would accept it from me and speak for me.
May the king, my lord, have mercy on his servant; may I not die (of shame) amidst all the people! May those who wish me ill not attain their heart's desire with regard to me!
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the drug about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, what the king, my lord, said is quite right.
Let us make those slaves drink first, and let the crown prince drink only afterwards. What am I to speak, an old man who has got no sense. (By contrast) what the king, my lord, said is as perfect as (the word) of the god.
To the ' farmer,' my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the ' farmer,' my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the ' farmer,' my lord!
On the 13th of Tammuz (IV), tomorrow, the ' farmer' goes to the qirsu, enters the reed hut, sits down, (then) returns from the qirsu and goes .... A barber enters. The nails which he cuts are put into a bottle (which) is sealed and brought to the border of the enemy country.
Alternatively, they go and do it in the same way on the 15th day.
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk, and the great gods of heaven and earth bless the king, my lord, and give happiness and physical well-being to the king, my lord!
The charge of the ' Lady of Cults' is doing very well; the king, my lord, can be happy.
Why, today already for the second day, is the table not brought to the king, my lord? Who (now) stays in the dark much longer than Šamaš, the king of the gods; stays in the dark a whole day and night, and again two days? The king, the lord of the world, is the very image of Šamaš. He (should) keep in the dark for half a day only!
Exaggeration is not good;
... the welfare of the country ......
Eating of bread and drinking of wine will soon remove the illness of the king.
Good advice is to be heeded: restlessness, not eating and not drinking disturbs the mind and adds to illness. In this matter the king should listen to his servant.
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Aššur, Sin, Šamaš, Adad, Marduk, Zarpanitu, Nabû, Tašmetu, Ištar of Nineveh, Ištar of Arbela, Ninurta, Gula, Nergal and Laṣ, the great gods of heaven and earth, very greatly bless the king, my lord, the truthful one, the benefactor and the lover of (his) people!
Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " May Aššur, Šamaš and my gods hear all these words you wrote to me" — they have surely heard them, and all the great gods of heaven and earth that are called by name have heard with them.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " I heard from the mouth of my father that you are a loyal family, but now I know it from my own experience" — the father of the king, my lord, was the very image of Bel, and the king, my lord, is likewise the very image of Bel. This (honour) has fallen to my share from the mouth of my two lords. Who can ever repeat it, who can vie with it?
Because the king, my lord, has gathered us and allowed us to stay in his entourage, may all the great gods of heaven and earth do in the same way to the king, my lord, including his seed, name and offspring, and introduce them into their families! As long as the moon and the sun stay firmly in the sky, may they, ' with the black-headed people,' rule over the country forever! And we, including our family, shall beseech the name of the great gods of heaven and earth for the life and vigour of the king, my lord. May the king, my lord, see our grandchildren grow old!
Concerning the matter about which the king, my lord, said: " Ask Nabû-nadin-šumi, he will tell you", he has gone to Calah, I have not been able to ask him.
Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " I have made Marduk-šakin-šumi available, he will assist you. Behold my favour, (for) this is it." I know it is a favour! May god and man together with me every day reward the favour of the king, my lord, a thousandfold!
On this very day I am no longer inadequate; after this favour ... of the king, my lord, ... even the hearts of our dead ancestors and dead ... have become happy.
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord!
The charge of the ' Lady of Cults' is doing very well; the king, my lord, can be very happy indeed.
May Aššur, Sin, Šamaš, Adad, Nusku, Jupiter, Venus, Marduk, Zarpanitu, Nabû, Tašmetu, Saturn, Mercury, Lady of Nineveh, Lady of Kidmuri, Lady of Arbela, Ninurta, Gula, Nergal and Laṣ, the great gods of heaven and earth, the gods dwelling in Assyria, the gods dwelling in Akkad, and all the gods of the world very greatly bless the king, my lord, and may they give the king, my lord, long days of life, numerous years, happiness, physical well-being, health and vigour!
As firmly as the moon and the sun are established in the sky, so firmly may the kingship of the king, my lord, and his descendants, be established in the whole world! May they (= the gods) let the king, my lord, see Assyria, Akkad and all the countries prosper. May they grant the king, my lord, happiness, physical well-being, joyful mind, extended old age, very long reign, increase of descendants and a still larger number of offspring.
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Bronchitis;
the enuru-incantation " Day of the Watch"
physiognomic omens;

To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The charge of the rear palace is doing well; he has lifted his head. May the great gods whom the king, my lord, invoked let the king, my lord, see him prosper!
From these words and these blessings which the king, my lord, sent and with which he blessed his dog, his servant, and the old man of his house —
(blessings) that will bring mighty countries to the king, my lord, and (make them) pray day and night, morning and evening, to the great gods of heaven and earth, the gods of Assyria, the gods of Babylonia, and of all the countries, for the life of the king, my lord, and the sons of the king, (blessings) that will give thousands and thousands of years of happiness and health to the king, my lord, —
now I know that the wisdom of Ea and Asalluhi and the activity of his servant will succeed, since the king, my lord, has sent these blessings to his servant.
To the crown prince of Assyria, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur, who constantly blesses you. Good health to the crown prince of the " Succession" palace, my lord!
May Aššur, Sin, Šamaš, Nabû and Marduk, and the great gods of heaven and earth bless the crown prince, my lord.
May they give happiness and health to the crown prince of the Succession Palace, my lord!
To the king, our lord: your servants Adad-šumu-uṣur and Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to the king, our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, our lord!
Concerning what the king wrote to us, he has assigned it as follows: " Once he is through with the Sumerian counterspells, he should thereafter finish the antiphone (series). Thereafter the others should do likewise."
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The charge of the ' Lady of Cults' is doing very well; the king, my lord, can be happy. May the great gods of heaven and earth let the king, my lord, see him prosper!
for his sons ...;
the incantation " Ištar, lady of war, who makes man and woman submit in battle." — These 3 tablets I have sealed and dispatched to the king, my lord.
A maid of the king has written to me from the palace: " Urad-Gula has said: ' Get me the girl Ṣuhru, I will dedicate (her) to the palace.' Send (word) whether he should bring (her) to you or to me."
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning what my lord wrote to me, I listen and obey. Tomorrow I shall go in my sedan chair ...
To the king, our lord: your servants Adad-šumu-uṣur and Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to the king, our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, our lord!
Concerning the child about whom the king, our lord
... upon them.
If it is acceptable to the king, orders should be given for the night. They should not hesitate.
To the ' farmer,' our lord: your servants Adad-šumu-uṣur and Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless our lord!
Concerning the girl about whom my lord said: " What time should she come in?" —
since he is an ' early bird,' let the day (= the sun) rise for an hour and a half, thereupon she may enter. Soon after that my lord should have himself shaved.
The ritual is on the evening of the 11th day.
To the king, our lord: your servants Adad-šumu-uṣur, Urad-Ea, Issar-šumu-ereš and Akkullanu. Good health to the king, our lord!
As to what the king, our lord, wrote to us: "...
Did he say ...?
... would have been cured. The king our lord should not be continuously eclipsed.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me, I am heeding it and am currently making the preparations.
As a matter of fact, there is little room for manoeuvering. If it is acceptable to the king, my lord, those others should perform (their rite only) after these have done with their performance. Or should we choose another place?
Nabû-gamil has come to Nineveh and said that Remutu, the exorcist who is in the service of the crown prince, is ill. Nabû-tartiba-uṣur, Šumaya son of Nabû-zeru-lešir, Urad-Gula, Nabû-le'uti, Bel-naṣir: anyone of these bearded courtiers whom the king, my lord, might choose can (fill his post and) serve the crown prince.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi:
Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the ritual about which the king said yesterday: " Get it done by the 24th day" — we cannot make it; the tablets are too numerous, (god only knows) when they will be written. Even the preparation of the figurines which the king saw (yesterday) took us 5 to 6 days.
Now, provided that the king, my lord, consents, the month Tebet (X) would be suitable for performing the counterspells. Let the crown prince perform (his part) during that (month), and let the people of the king too perform (their parts) during it. What harm (would it do)?
And concerning the Sumerian texts of the counterspells about which the king said: " Send (word)! They should be brought from Nineveh!" — I shall send Nadin-ahhe; he will go and bring them. He will also bring with him the other tablets of the ' refrain series.' Let the king perform (his part) on the 2nd of Tebet (X), the crown prince on the 4th and the people on the 6th.
Alternatively, we may perform (the ritual) on other days, if (the proposed schedule) is troublesome (or) not executable.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the application of the ṣillibānu-treatment about which the king, my lord, said: " It is very hot" —
it must be hot; why (else) are we doing this? Did he not (intend) heat, (when) he said " It should make him sweat?" But why is he seized by ague, through it is early summer? This does not make any sense. It is work of the gods.
And concerning the string of (amulet) stones — what the king, my lord, said is quite correct. Did I not tell the king, my lord, (already) in the enemy country that they are unsuited to Assyria? Now we shall stick to the methods transmitted to the king, my lord, by the gods (themselves).
I am now writing to the king, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the ritual about which I just wrote to the king, my lord, " They should go out and perform it tomorrow" —
it had slipped my mind that tomorrow is the day of the city god. I was too hasty there; it is not good to go out and perform it. We shall get together and perform it only on the 7th day.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
May we bring these skulls prescribed in the ritual into the qirsu, clothe them with garments and install them there? Let them write me what the king, my lord, commands.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the prophylactic figurines about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, " Where will they be buried?" — it is said in the (ritual) tablet as follows: " You bury them at the outer gate." Now, with the king's permission, ......
Also tomorrow, after the king has gone out, they should bury them in front of the main room and the bedrooms, in places to be additionally specified by the king. Daytime or nighttime makes no difference; one may bury whenever one likes.
I, for my part, will bury (figurines) in the said way here.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
3 ' hand-lifting' prayers (to be recited) before Nusku,
3 before the moon, 3 before the Pleiades,
2 before Sirius,
2 before Mars,
2 before Vega,
2 before the star ....,
1 before the star....,
1 before the star....,
the incantation " Ea, Šamaš and Asalluhi" belonging to the apotropaic ritual against all kinds of evil, as well as the apotropaic ritual (called) " If the Moon and the Sun have become a grievance to the ruler and his country" —
(these) tablets, totalling 21, I have today performed on the river bank; Urad-Ea will perform (his share) on the roof of the palace tonight.
(As) the king, my lord, knows, an exorcist has to avoid reciting a ' hand-lifting' prayer on an evil day: (therefore) I shall now look up, collect and copy numerous — 20 to 30 — canonical and non-canonical tablets, (but) perform (the prayers) (only) tomorrow evening and on the night of the 15th day.
On the 16th and 17th I shall perform those before Venus, Mullissu, Zarpanitu, Tašmetu, Gula and Nanaya as well. I have opened my fists and prayed to the gods: all is well, the gods have blessed the king, my lord, and his sons.
Nevertheless, if it pleases the king, my lord, let them write to Calah and have the ' hand-lifting' prayers before the Moon god and the apotropaic ritual against evil of all kind performed for the crown prince and the prince of Babylon. What harm (would it do)?
I am also worried about the impending observation of the moon; let this be my advice. If it is suitable, let us put somebody on the throne. (When) the night of the 15th day comes, he will be afflicted by it; but he will save your life.
I am listening — the king, my lord, knows the Babylonians and what they plot and repeat. (These) plotters should be afflicted! Tomorrow — if it seems good — I shall come to the audience and speak to the king.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The crown prince is well; Šamaš-šumu-ukin is well.
Concerning the rites accompanying the incantation " Verily You are Evil" about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, they are performed to drive out the evil demon and epilepsy.
As soon as something has afflicted him (= the patient), the exorcist rises and hangs a mouse and a shoot of a thornbush on the vault of the (patient's) door. The exorcist dresses in a red garment and puts on a red cloak. He (holds) a raven on his right, a falcon on his left, and pours ... on the censer of the ' 7 gates,' grasps a ..., holds a torch in his hand, strikes with a whip and recites the incantation " Verily You are Evil.
After he has finished, he makes another exorcist go around the bed of the patient, followed by a censer and a torch, recites the incantation " Begone Evil hultuppu" (going) as far as to the door and (then) conjures the door.
Until (the demon) is driven out, he does (this) (every) morning and evening.
Concerning (the fact) that on the 13th instant the moon and sun were seen together, there is a ritual to be performed against it. Let Nabû-gamil come and perform it according to my instructions; he should also perform (the ritual) for Urad-Ea.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the counterspells which we earlier had to interrupt and did not finish performing, we could now, with the king my lord's permission, continue with them. Because of the temperature, the ritual was not completed ... upon the clothes of the later people who .......
At the same time we could also perform those rites of the series Šurpu about which I said to the king, my lord: " We should perform them for ...."
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi. The best of health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May they sate the king, my lord, with old age and fullness of life!
... and the night of the 20th day ...... before Sirius
If it is convenient, let the king, my lord, put on white clothes on the 20th, and ask for food at a polished table.
(As) the king, my lord, knows, it is a house of mourning. From Marduk-šakin-šumi.
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Ea. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû, Marduk, Sin and Nikkal bless the king, my lord!
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Ea. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû, Marduk, Sin, Nikkal and Nusku bless the king, my lord!
The Moon god (and his consort) Nikkal ......
...... have blessed the king, my lord, and given a life of distant days to the king, my lord!
I pray day and night for the life of the king, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Ea. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû, Marduk, Sin and Nikkal bless the king, my lord!
The gods of Kurba'il set off (for the akītu-temple) under my direction, and the garments of the king go (along). Year after year they go on like this; the penitential psalm is performed over them, (and the gods) bless the king, my lord.
Let the king, my lord, (now) order that they give the garments.
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-šumu-ereš. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Has any curse been written there?" —
I have checked and there is none. A curse has (definitely) not been written.
To the king, our lord: your servants Issar-šumu-ereš, Adad-šumu-uṣur and Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to the king, our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, our lord!
On the 18th day the god Bel, together with his divine escort, was in the city of Labbanat. Everything was just fine.
Bel-eriba and Nergal-šallim, servants of the household of the crown prince, under the jurisdiction of the governor of the city of Šamaš-naṣir, were attending, in Labbanat, to a strong horse harnessed in trappings of the land of Kush for the (ceremonial) entrance into the city (of Babylon). Nergal-šallim took hold of the feet of Bel-eriba and helped him to mount the horse. They saw (this), seized and questioned him. He said: " The gods Bel and Zarpanitu have sent word to me: ' Babylon — straight — the loot of Kurigalzu.'"
NN, the ' third man' of ... claims as follows: " I know! — Those robbers are waiting in Dur-Kurigalzu."
What is it that the king, our lord, orders?
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-šumu-ereš. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The scribes, the haruspices, the exorcists, the physicians and the augurs staying in the palace and living in the city will enter the treaty on the 16th of Nisan (I).
Now, let them conclude the treaty tomorrow.
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-šumu-ereš. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " What apotropaic ritual is there?" — there is the apotropaic ritual against earthquake, and it should be performed; ... should enter the Review Palace. The following (is) what is said about the matter in the tablet:
If ......, ... will stay ...
If ......, in that year the prince ......
... everybody has now ...
... ed, picked up ..., and ......
The king, my lord, should not be worried about it.
Now it has again quaked in the daytime:
If the earth trembles in the daytime, dispersal of the land.
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-šumu-eres. Good health to the king, my lord!
Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " The present day, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow, these are (the days) of the displays!" —
on the ... th day the king, my lord, said as follows about the old displays: " In Arbela, the display should take place from the 27th till the 29th day."
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-šumu-ereš. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the royal statues in the city of Harran, about which the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Write out for me the favourable month and day on which they should enter (the city), and also the place where they should stand" — the month ... is auspicious for the transportation and the setting up (of the statues). The relevant interpretation is as follows:
If it is acceptable to the king, my lord, the large royal statues should be erected on the right and the left side of the Moon god. The statuettes of the king's sons should be set up behind and in front of the Moon god. The Moon, lord of the crown, will (then) every month without fail, in rising and setting, unceasingly send happy signs of long-lasting days, steady reign and increase in power to the king, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-šumu-ereš. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " One of your colleagues wrote to me: the planet Mercury will be visible in the month Nisan (I). What do you take the present month to be?" — we take the present month to be Adar (XII) and we take this day to be the 25th.
The person who wrote this ... to the king, my lord, ...
" An incompetent one can frustrate a judge, an uneducated one can make the mighty worry" — this is what is said.
Concerning the planet Venus about which the king, my lord, wrote to me: " When will you tell me (what) ' Venus is stable in the morning' (means)?" —
it is written as follows in the commentary: " Venus is stable in the morning: (the word) ' morning' (here) means to be bright, it is shining brightly, (and the expression) ' its position is stable' means it is lighted in the west."
To the ' farmer,' my lord: your servant Issar-šumu-ereš. Good health to the ' farmer,' my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the ' farmer,' my lord!
Concerning the watch (for the lunar eclipse) about which the ' farmer', my lord, wrote to me: "...
" If it should occur, what is the word about it?" — the 14th day (signifies) the Eastland, the month Sivan (III) (signifies) the Westland, and the relevant ' decision' (pertains) to Ur. And if it occurs, the (interpretation concerning the) region it afflicts and the wind blowing will be quoted as well.
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-šumu-ereš. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-šumu-ereš. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me:
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-šumu-ereš. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, recently wrote to me: " As ... all ...... of the queen mother ...
Concerning ......, the father of the king introduced you into the Succession Palace; nothing is said about the queen mother there.
To the king, my lord: your servant Akkullanu. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Yesterday, on the 3rd, Aššur and Mullissu went out in peace and re-entered (Ešarra) safely; all the gods who went out with Aššur took up their residence in peace. The king, my lord, can be happy. May Aššur and Mullissu keep the king, my lord, alive for a hundred years.
The king, my lord, did not question (the officials) who, in ... and in the ... temple, fill the vats in front of the king's table, (but) are now on strike, about whom I wrote to the king, my lord. Now, in the month Tishri (VII), they have filled neither the libation wine nor the vats in front of Aššur; neither the wine master, nor his deputy, nor his secretary! They are on strike hand in hand (lit. foot to foot). The king, my lord, should know (this).
To the king, my lord: your servant Akkullanu. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the constant sheep offering and the regular deliveries to Aššur about which the king, my lord, wrote to his servant: " Who of the magnates have not agreed to give them?" —
I was not able to specify (them and thus) did not write to the king, my lord yesterday. (Now then) here are the magnates who have not given the sheep offerings:
The governors of Barhalzi, Raṣappa, Kilizi, Isana, Tillê, Kullania, and Arpadda. All (these) have not given the constant sheep-offering.
Raṣappa, Barhalzi, Diquqina, the chief of granaries, Dayyan-Adad, Isana, Halzi-atbar, Birtu, Arzuhina, Arbela, Guzana, Šahuppa, Tamnuna, Talmusa. All these have not given the regular deliveries of barley and emmer.
Furthermore, concerning the priest of the cook's house, the priest of the confectioner's and the chief baker, about whom the king, my lord, inquired, they were originally shaved. Their story is as follows: The priest of the little cook's house was shaved by Sennacherib, (but) a priest from Nineveh, Aššur-zeru-iddina, denounced him and he was flogged with leather whips. He retained his headgear, (however, since) he had committed no serious crime.
The father of the (present) priest of the confectioner's house set the (sacrificial) table of Aššur; whereupon he was killed. This one was appointed by your father to take care of the table. He is son of an owner of a headgear; (it is only) due to an oversight (that) he has not been shaved.
And concerning the chief baker, Sennacherib appointed him to supervise their ' bread.' Indeed he was shaved and received his headgear in his reign. It is now the eighth year since he died, and his son is at present ' standing with his hair' (expecting to be shaved).
Indeed, in the old times — until the reigns of Sargon and Sennacherib — they were shaved. This was their story; the king, my lord, may act as he prefers.
To the king, my lord: your servant Akkullanu. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
In the answer to my letter, may the king, my lord, write his servant that the king, my lord, is well, happy and in good health.
To the king, my lord: your servant Akkullanu. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
It is my duty to praise them; I do it for the sake of the life of the king, my lord. Perhaps the king, my lord, will say, " What is (this) praise?" — it is the spindle (symbol); I carry it three days for Venus. The king, my lord, should know and hear (this, lest) the king, my lord, might say: " Why have I not learned and heard that you have to do (this)?" Now the king should know that I am doing (this).
To the king, my lord: your servant Akkullanu. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the substitute image about which the king, my lord, wrote to his servant: " It was sitting (on the throne) in the city of Akkad from the 14th of Tammuz (IV) till the 5th of Ab (V)" — for what purpose did they act in this way? And why did they enthrone it in Akkad? Had they done it in the city of your father where you yourself are living, it would have removed your evil! Why you? And why an evil of Babylonia?
Have they (perhaps) said to you on this matter: " Your father enthroned (his substitutes) there." These (words) are rubbish! Why did the king not say to them like this: " The evil of my father was in one region, mine is in another; the evil of Assyria and Babylonia are not interrelated: when a sign pertaining to Assyria appears, (the ritual) should be performed here, and when a sign pertaining to Babylonia appears, it should be done there." Now the king of Babylonia is well ...... You are still ......
Perhaps the king says: " What is the substitute (then)?" — the Series itself has said (as follows) in connection with this Nisan (I) eclipse: " If during the eclipse, Jupiter stands there: well-being for the king, a famous noble will die in his stead." Has the king paid attention (to this)? A full month had not yet passed (before) his sartinnu was dead. Now the king has (already) twice performed an apotropaic ritual for him; (but) when have you actually performed one for yourself?
If I had not addressed the king today, wouldn't the king say to his servant tomorrow: " You were a servant of my father; why didn't you advise and instruct me?"
That is also (why) I chose these very words from my heart: " I shall speak in the king's presence about directing away the evil of the land of Subartu." I sent these words to the king, my lord, already as early as on the 12th of Tammuz (IV); (but) I saw the answer (only) on the 8th of Ab (V). Why, O king, my lord? —
May the king, my lord, write to his servant that the king is well and happy.
To the king, my lord: your servant Akkullanu. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Tomorrow evening there will be a (cultic) bath in the city of Tarbiṣu, and sacrifices of the king will be performed. Shall I go?
If I had not reminded (the king) today, wouldn't the king, my lord, get furious and say: " Why did you not remind me?"
To the king, my lord: your servant Akkullanu. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the priests of Calah about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me, I questioned a priest personally; he said as follows:
" Nobody has hea rd their story .... I gave the order: ' Let them be held in my house ... until the king summons them and asks about his servants who were killed.'"
To the king, my lord: your servant Akkullanu. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the priest about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me, now then — today is the third day already — he has thought it over and said to me as follows:
" What is this? It should be cleared up! If there is anything left of it, let them send it to me, and I will make it double at once. Within ...... has not sent ... as to where it would be.
" Concerning what the king said, viz. ' Three years ago you ......,' is this not what ......?
" The container for firewood ......
" white frit ......
of the son of the priest ......
in the papāhu chapel ......
and the head ......
inside it ......
" the river ordeal on account of ......
" Let me ...... this
" Now ......
Also let them have a word with the governor of GN; why are the king's ... s negligent? The ...... s have left their work.
Let the king inquire about ... the sacrifices of the deputy governor of GN: " Why have you not provided them?" The king should make it crystal-clear to him that these days of the kanūnu (festival) must not be left loose!
The kanūnu is on the evening of the 10th. Huge sacrifices will be (performed) on the 11th and the 12th day.
Furthermore, as regards the priest of the temple of Sibitti of Nineveh about whom I wrote to the king, my lord: " He wants to tell something — he should be questioned" —
the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Let him be in attendance." So far nobody has questioned him.
The name of the son of the priest of the Šamaš temple is Zarî, (he is) the son of Nadin-apli.
To the king, my lord: your servant Akkullanu. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May I hear (about) the king, my lord's health and well-being in the answer to my letter.
Concerning the observation of the moon and the sun, here is the relevant interpretation:
If on the 14th of Tebet (X) the moon is not seen with the sun: there will be deaths, and the god will eat.
If on the 15th day the moon and the sun are seen together: a strong enemy will raise his weapons against the country, and the enemy will demolish the city gates.
If (the opposition) is observed on the 15th day: bad for Akkad, good for the Eastland and the Westland.
If a fog rolls in Tebet (X): eclipse of all countries."
Concerning the king's sacrifices which are performed in the kanūnu festival, shall I go and supervise the sacrifices? Or shall I stay here? What is it that the king says? (If I didn't ask), the king, my lord, would say: " Why did you not remind me?"
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-nadin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the apotropaic ritual against evil of any kind, about which the king wrote to me: " Perform it tomorrow" — the day is not propitious. We shall prepare it on the 25th and perform it on the 26th.
Anyway, the king, my lord, should not be worried about this portent. Bel and Nabû can make a portent pass by, and they will make it bypass the king, my lord. The king, my lord, should not be afraid.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-nadin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord.
Concerning the purification which I was ordered (to perform), I have gone and undertaken an effective one. From Nineveh I took the road to Zikkû and went as far as to Sasiqani; (there) I gave the (following) order to the courier who had accompanied me from Nineveh and to the courier of the city of Calah: " You carry along (this torch and this censer and) move them about in the city of Kasappa."
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-nadin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk greatly bless the king, my lord!
Concerning what the king, my lord, said to me: " Discuss it with Balasî", I did so and he said:
" He should sit down on the 15th and get up on the 22nd; on the 24th day the king should go down to the river and perform his ritual."
He also said: " Let us talk (about this) to the king (himself), and let the king hear what we have to say." He and I should (now) have an audience with the king; we shall instruct the king, our lord, how the ritual will be performed. It is a complicated one, and it is essential that the king listens to what we have to say.
Concerning the izbu (= anomalous birth) ritual about which the king wrote to me: " It is obscure" — I sent the king exactly what is written on the tablet.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-nadin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk greatly bless the king, my lord!
Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " You ask (him)!" —
I don't know who this man is — whom should I ask? Let the man be pointed out to me (then), I will ask him.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-nadin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk greatly bless the king, my lord!
At night the king will perform Maqlû, in the early morning the king will perform the balance of the ritual.
Furthermore: the (periodic) rites of the month Ab (V) which will be performed on the 2 8 th day involve the presence of a figurine of Gilgameš.
Should I perform (these rites) for the queen mother? What is it that the king says?
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-nadin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk greatly bless the king, my lord!
The king, my lord sent me (saying): " Go and perform a ritual for Šadditu!" — I did so, (but) I could not perform the rest of the ritual (because) I had to leave for the treaty. Why on earth did Šumaya hurry up from Calah and say to Šadditu: " I shall prepare and perform this ... ritual for you!"
He should ... have asked me!
...... ritual
I would have performed ......
... performed ...
I would have seen ......
...... Calah
... But he
... came up
He is not able to perform (the ritual) " Excluding evil from a person's home," (but instead) has exposed her.
The king sent me; why did he hasten to perform (the ritual)? He is not able (at all)! I will perform it — or should I have learned from his example?
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-nadin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk very greatly bless the king, my lord!
If he has become troublesome, may that gracious face of the king, my lord, turn away from him! And inasmuch as Ištar of Nineveh and Ištar of Arbela have said: " We shall root out from Assyria those who are not loyal to the king, our lord!" he should really be banished from Assyria!
May Aššur, Šamaš, Bel and Nabû feel concern over the health of the king, my lord!
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-nadin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk greatly bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the governor ...
Let them recite it, write it down and send it to him; he will get afraid of the king and obey.
Otherwise I swear by your gods that he shall not obey but take away (the country) and separate (from Assyria).
A servant of the king has come ......
To the scribe of the palace, my lord: your servant Nabû-šumu-iddina. Good health to my lord! May Nabû and Marduk, Ištar of Nineveh and Ištar of Arbela bless my lord! May they keep you in good health, and may you constantly be happy!
The palace and the inhabitants of Nineveh are well; may Bel and Nabû also grant health to you!
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-šumu-iddina of Nineveh. May Nabû and Marduk
To the king, my lord: your servant Balasî. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " In the city of Harihumba lightning struck and ravaged the fields of the Assyrians" — why does the king look for (trouble), and why does he look (for it) in the home of a tiller? There is no evil inside the palace, and when has the king ever visited Harihumba?
Now, provided that there is (evil) inside the palace, they should go and perform the (ritual) " Evil of Lightning" there. In case the king, my lord, says: " How is it said (in the tablets)?" — (here is the relevant interpretation): " If the storm god devastates a field inside or outside a city, or if he puts down a ... of (his) chariot, or if fire burns anything, the said man will live in utter misery for 3 years." This applies (only) to the one who was cultivating the field.
Concerning the adding of the intercalary month about which the king wrote to me, this is (indeed) a leap year. After Jupiter has become visible, I shall write (again) to the king, my lord. I am waiting for it; it will take this whole month. Then we shall see how it is and when we have to add the intercalary month.
To the king, my lord: your servant Balasî. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the ... about which the king, my lord, wrote to me — the dream rituals should be performed on the 13th day, in the morning. On the 13th day the moon will be covered with the crown of splendour. Afterwards, ... on the 14th day, the moon will be seen in opposition to the sun, a good oracular utterance will answer you.
May Aššur, Bel, Nabû and Šamaš bless the king, my lord! May they give life of distant days, old age and fullness of life to the king, my lord!
The 13th is a propitious day; let them perform it.
To the king, our lord: your servants Balasî and Nabû-ahhe-eriba. Good health to the king, our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, our lord!
Concerning Aššur-mukin-paleya about whom the king, our lord, wrote to us, may Aššur, Bel, Nabû, Sin, Šamaš and Adad bless him, and may the king, our lord, see him prosper. It is (a) good (time) for (his) going (to the king): the 2nd is a good day, and the 4th is a very good day.
To the king, our lord: your servants Balasî and Nabû-ahhe-eriba. Good health to the king, our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, our lord!
The king, our lord, will pardon us. Is one day not enough for the king to mope and to eat nothing? For how long (still)? This is already the third day (when) the king does not eat anything. The king, a beggar!
(Surely) when, in the beginning of the month, the moon appears, he says: " I will not fast (any more)! It is the beginning of the month! I want bread to eat and wine to drink!"
Now Jupiter is the moon. The king can ask for food for even the whole of the year! We became worried and were afraid, and that is why we are (now) writing to the king.
To the king, our lord: your servants Balasî and Nabû-ahhe-eriba. Good health to the king, our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, our lord!
Concerning the planets Saturn and Mars ...
There is (still) (a distance of) about 5 fingers left; it (= the conjunction) is not yet certain. Presently we keep observing and shall write to the king, our lord. It (= Mars) moves about a finger a day.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-ahhe-eriba. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " From now on you will stay in my entourage; if there is something you want to say, write me" — how would I not stand in front of the king, my lord? To whom else would we be devoted?
The king, my lord, went away until the fourth month; how could I not be shaken up (when) I cannot look at the king, my lord; why should I not embrace (the ground) where the tracks of the chariot of the king, my lord, pass by, (longing) to look at the king, my lord, again? May Bel and Nabû lengthen the days of the king, my lord!
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-ahhe-eriba. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The gods saw each other on the 13th day.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-ahhe-eriba. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the crown prince about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me saying that the crown prince should visit the king, my lord, (and asking) " Is the 1st of Nisan (I) favourable?" —
On the 1st of Nisan (I) he should cleanse and purify oneself, make his food offering to Marduk, libate water and first-quality beer to the right and to the left; (then) this man will shine like the sun.
On the 2nd he should not go into the street.
On the 4th of Nisan (I) he should prostrate himself before Marduk and make his sign known; he will (then) be granted fame and prosperity.
" He should make his sign known" (means) he should plead his case before the god.
Another matter: The planet Mercury is shining very brightly; it (signifies) the crown prince. This is propitious for the country of Subartu, and propitious for the king and the crown prince. (If) the crown prince is to come into the presence of the king, my lord, it is (now) favourable to do so.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me saying that Aššur-mukin-paleya should appear before the king, my lord — as soon as the planet Venus has become visible, he may come. Venus will presently make a good omen; meanwhile the month Nisan (I) has arrived. The constellation Aries is setting and will (soon) be completely gone. The king, my lord, should still wait for its emergence; thereafter he may come. May Bel and Nabû let the king, my lord, see Aššur-mukin-paleya prosper.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-ahhe-eriba. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the muster about which the king, my lord, wrote to me — ... ... ...
I have sent ... to the king, my lord; the king may act as it (best) suits the king, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Nanaya. The very best of health to the king, my lord! May Ninurta and Gula give happiness and physical well-being to the king, my lord!
The crown prince is doing very well. The treatment which we carried out and gave to the chest lasted for 1 1/2 hours; he retained consciousness and afterwards sat up (in his bed). How proper he is!
Concerning the patient whose nose bleeds, the rab mūgi told me that much blood flowed yesterday evening.
They are handling those tampons ignorantly! They put them against the cartilage of the nose, pressing the cartilage, and that is why the blood keeps coming out. They should put them into the openings of the nostrils; it will cut off the breath but the blood will be held back.
With the king's consent, I will enter (the palace) tomorrow and give instructions. Now let me to hear about the (king's) health.
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Nanaya: The very best of health to the king, my lord! May Ninurta and Gula give happiness and physical well-being to the king, my lord!
Aššur-mukin-palu'a is doing very well. The king should not be afraid of this fever which has two or three times seized him; his pulse is normal and sound; he is well.
The baby, the crown prince and all the children of the king, my lord are (likewise) doing well.
Concerning the cure of the teeth about which the king wrote to me, I will (now) begin with it; there are a great number of remedies for (aching) teeth.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Is it (true that) you have been concerned about yourself?" —
when am I ever free? I take care of Aššur-mukin-paleya; and as soon as I saw him healthy (again), I came for the health of the king.
Now, O king, my lord, I should be released for a full month! I must do something — otherwise I shall die.
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Nanaya. The very best of health to the king, my lord! May Ninurta and Gula give happiness and physical well-being to the king, my lord!
Concerning the rash about which the king, my lord, wrote to me: " With what should they anoint my ...? (When) ... is finished, the r ash subsides for the rest of the day" —
the king should rub himself with bird fat; it should protect the king from drafts. The clean water with which the king regularly washes his hands in the washbowl should not be hot. The rash will soon be gone (if the king acts in this way).
I have gone where the king sent me.
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Gula. Good health to the king, my lord! May all the gods whom the king, my lord, has revered today, very much stand by the king and by Assurbanipal and Šamaš-šumu-ukin on (the day of) their trial!
We prepared all this work that the king performed on the 22nd day and today, and we also wrote the tablets, (while) he did not go near anything because of the picking (of fruit) and harvesting (of grapes).
And on the 22nd, when the king got angry, we ... d the (ground) beneath the god and worried to death. But he, as soon as ..., wine ...
He is taking for himself the prime lot of garments which came in on the 22nd and today, gu lēnu-coats, tunics, and mak lulu-clothes, every single one of them, and shows neither the chief exorcist nor Adad-šumu-uṣur that he has them.
But we have ended up empty-handed; by which means are we supposed to fill the shortage of our garments? Whence are we supposed to get (our) wages, we who have not (even) as much money as a pupil of his? And yet the king knows that we are his equals!
... We are alone; (already) in the time of the king's father, Balas su and Aplaya took the stand because of him before ... and Adad-šumu-uṣur.
We have ended up empty-handed ......
...... is not there ......
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Gula. The best of health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk very greatly bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the (periodic) rites of the month Ab (V) about which the king, my lord, said: " Perform them!" — we shall perform them exactly on schedule. The man who runs according to the word of his master — the gods will give him a good genie, and a safe road will be guided to him.
... the king, his favour ...
We are not worried; however, an order should be given to the effect that we are allowed to enter regularly.
Concerning what the king, my lord, said: " Which exorcists are with you?" — there are (only) Nabû-le'utu, his son, and I. At present Adad-šumu-uṣur is coming to us, checking our work and instructing us; we are collaborating closely. It is because of this that I am writing to the king, my lord.
(When) Nabû-le'utu and his son are alone, who can vouch for them, whether it is safe or not? Even I have noticed that this son of his is (still) in the unsteadiness of youth. (While) I stay with them, we perform the ritual correctly — (but) can I leave them alone?
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû'a. May Aššur, Šamaš, Bel and Nabû bless the king, my lord, and let the king, my lord, attain his desire!
We kept the watch; on the 14th day the moon and the sun saw each other.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû'a. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
On the 7th of Kislev (IX) a fox entered the Inner City, and fell into a well in the garden of the god Aššur. It was hauled up and killed.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-naṣir. May Nabû and Marduk very greatly bless the king, my lord!
The charge of the ' Lady of Cults' is doing very well; the king, my lord, can be glad indeed.
May the king, my lord, lift the grandchildren of the charge of the ' Lady of Cults' upon his knees and see gray hairs in their beards!
To the king, our lord: your servants Marduk-šumu-uṣur, Naṣiru and Aqaraya. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, our lord!
We have rites to perform in the qirsu. Let the king, our lord, give an order to Sasî (that) they should let us go. Nobody will release us, and we cannot go out.
To the ' farmer,' my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. May Nabû and Marduk bless the ' farmer,' my lord.
After they have gone to the qirsu and entered the reed hut, they return from there, and the barber enters.
To the king, my lord: your servant Banî. The very best of health to the king, my lord! May Ninurta and Gula give happiness and physical well-being to the king, my lord!
Concerning Nabû-nadin-šumi about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Why do you lie?" —
would I lie to the king, my lord? (Your) gods Bel and Nabû, who give you confidence, they made him recover! The Lady of Life, your gracious, who gives the king, my lord, long-lasting days, old age, fullness of life, health and vigour, she grasped his hand! He got well thanks to the god and genie of the king, my lord!
To the ' farmer,' my lord: your servant Nabû-zeru-lešir. Good health to my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless my lord for many years!
I wrote down whatever signs there were, be they celestial, terrestrial or of malformed births, and had them recited in front of Šamaš, one after the other. They (the substitute king and queen) were treated with wine, washed with water and anointed with oil; I had those birds cooked and made them eat them. The substitute king of the land of Akkad took the signs on himself.
He cried out: " Because of what ominous sign have you enthroned a substitute king?" And he claims: " Say in the presence of the ' farmer': on the evening of the xth, we were drinking wine. Ṣallaya gave bribes to his servant Nabû-uṣalli and meanwhile he inquired about Nikkal-iddina, Šamaš-ibni, and Na'id-Marduk, speaking about upheaval of the country: ' Seize the fortified places one after another!' He is to be watched (carefully); he should no (longer) belong to the entourage of the ' farmer.' His servant Nabû-uṣalli should be questioned — he will spill everything."
To the king, my lord: your servant Ikkaru. The very best of health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May Ninurta and Gula give happiness and physical well-being to the king, my lord!
Concerning (the prince) NN about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Sit up with him!" —
I stay awake with him all night, (but) he makes no progress.
The king, my lord, should know that he is ill; the king should not find fault with us later on. I have applied two or three lotions, (but) he has not seen any improvement.
To the king, my lord: your servant Ikkaru. Good health to the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me:
To the king, our lord: your servants Ikkaru and NN. Good health to the king, our lord!
To the king, my lord: your servant Mar-Issar. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May the great gods bestow long days, well-being and joy upon the king, my lord!
Concerning ... about which I formerly wrote to the king, my lord
The king, my lord, should act as he considers best.
I have now written on the pedestal of the goddess Tašmetu the inscription which the king, my lord, communicated in the previous letter. I placed the statues of the king, my lord, upon the pedestals right and left. The king, my lord, should know (this).
They say: (Concerning) the watch for the moon, he (= the moon) will make (the eclipse) pass by in the second Elul (VI/2); it is expected to take place in Tishri (VII)."
The 3rd of Elul.
To the ' farmer,' our lord: your servants Nabû-zeru-lešir, Adad-šumu-uṣur, Nabû-šumu-iddina, Urad-Ea and Issar-šumu-ereš. Good health to our lord!
We shall go to Nineveh.
To the king, my lord: your servant Mar-Issar. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May the great gods bestow long days, well-being and joy upon the king, my lord!
Concerning the lunar eclipse about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, it was observed in the cities of Akkad, Borsippa, and Nippur. What we saw in Akkad corresponded to the other (observation)s. A bronze kettledrum was set up; the darkness ......
I have extracted the relevant interpretation written on the tablet and sent it, together with this letter, to the king, my lord. Moreover, I shall keep the watch for the solar eclipse, as the king, my lord, wrote to me. Whether it occurs or not, I shall write to the king, my lord, whatever it may be.
This lunar eclipse which took place, afflicted all countries, but all its evil is heaped upon the Westland. " Westland" means the Hittite country (Syria) or, according to another interpretation, Chaldea. With the king, my lord, all is well. However, the guard should not be neglected, and the relevant apotropaic ritual should be performed for the king, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant Mar-Issar. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May the great gods bestow long days, well-being and joy upon the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " The month Elul (VI) is intercalary; do not perform the ceremonies this month" —
Ammu-salam entered Babylon on the evening of the 6th day; the god Nabû had come before him, on the 3rd. The gate was kept open before Bel and Nabû on the 4th, the 5th and the 6th, and sacrifices were performed.
When I saw the king my lord's sealed order, I issued the order: the rest of the ceremonies of Elul (VI) will be performed in the coming month, as the king, my lord, wrote to me.
To the king, my lord: your servant Mar-Issar. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May the great gods bestow long days, well-being and joy upon the king, my lord!
The governor of Dur-Šarruku has already previously opened my seals, taken 10 minas of silver, 1400 sheep and 15 oxen belonging to the gods Šimalu'a and Humhum and distributed them to ... his retinue.
...... I
...... my seals
The governors who were before him did not take anything from the temples — now he has recklessly opened a treasury of the god and the king, my lord, and taken silver from it.
If the Prefect of the land and the governors of Nineveh and Arbela took silver from temples, then he too mmight take it. It is treasure of the god and the king, my lord; why is it being squandered?
Let the king, my lord, send a trusty bodyguard to investigate (the matter); the man who put the governor up to this should be punished. Let (the others) know and be frightened off, or else the governors will dissipate all the treasures of the temples. The king, my lord, should know this.
To the king, my lord: your servant Mar-Issar. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May the great gods bestow long days, well-being and joy upon the king, my lord!
Concerning the gusīgu-jewelry about which I wrote to the king, my lord: " It has not been brought" — 30 jewels, sealed, were dispatched to me via my messenger whom I had sent to the palace. He brought them on the 2nd and I received them with the seal intact, thanks to the genie of the king, my lord. Moreover, the bodyguard Nabû-le'i, brought me, likewise on the 2nd of Ab (V) 26 ' eye-stones' of serpentine belonging to the king, my lord, and 1 mina of gold belonging to the queen mother, my lady, and I received them with the seal intact.
They will be used for the tiara of Nabû as the king, my lord, wrote. May Bel and Nabû destine dignity, fortune, fullness of life and old age for the king, my lord, for the queen mother and my lords the princes! May they deliver the enemies of the king, my lord, into the hands of the king, my lord!
The commandant of Babylon will, perhaps, write to the king, my lord: " The citizens of Babylon have thrown lumps of clay at me," but that is a lie. Necessitated by the fact that the commandants were told to ready their war-chariots they assigned much silver (dues) to the citizens of Babylon, Borsippa and Cutha, and collected it. The citizens of Babylon, poor wretches who have got nothing, set up a wail and protested. (Whereupon) the commandant imprisoned (some) men from amongst them (on the pretense): " You threw lumps of clay at my messengers."
He has also written to the wife of the judge Ṭabî: " Let your husband be in your custody — he may not go outdoors!" I have heard that (this) judge Ṭabî incited the men who protested.
This was the story; the king, my lord, should know it.
To the king, our lord: your servants, the scribes of Kilizi. Good health to the king, our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king!
We watched the moon; on the 14th day the moon and the sun saw each other. (This means) well-being.
May Nabû and Marduk bless the king. Because of the ilku-duty and the corvée work we cannot keep the watch of the king, and the pupils do not learn the scribal craft.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, said: " My arms and legs are without strength!" and " I cannot open my eyes; I am scratched and lie prostrate"—
(all) that is because this fever has lingered inside the very bones. It is not serious — Aššur, Šamaš, Bel and Nabû will provide health.
His illness will depart — he will be just fine. True, they should wait and eat (only) what is appropriate.
To the king, my lord: your servant Balasî. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the watch of the moon about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, (the eclipse) will pass by, it will not occur.
Concerning the watch of the sun about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, does the king, my lord, not know that it is being closely observed? The day of tomorrow is the only (day left); once the watch is over, (this eclipse), too, will have passed by, it will not occur.
To the king, my lord: your servant Balasî. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May Aššur, Bel and Nabû give happiness and joy to the king, my lord!
The moon has taken an auspicious aspect: it is the beginning of the month.
Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me — today is an ' evil day,' I shall write (about it) tomorrow. Thinking about these matters today is not good; I shall write tomorrow.
To the king, my lord: your servant Balasî. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the raven about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, (here are the relevant omens):
If a raven brings something into the house of a man, the said man will obtain something that does not belong to him.
If a falcon or a raven drops something it carries into the house of a man, (or) according to a variant, before a man, the said house will have išdihu. Išdihu (means) profit.
If a bird carries flesh, a bird, or anything, and drops it into the house of a man, the said man will receive a large inheritance.
May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord, and may they give life of distant days, old age and fullness of life to the king, my lord!
I have servants in the land of the Chief Cupbearer, and I have fields and orchards (there). (But) the servants of the Chief Cupbearer, coveting my orchards, have snatched them and chased my people away. From the moment they chased them, they (= my people) got into a panic and disappeared. May the gods not forsake me! May the king feel pity (for his servant)! May a guard be appointed for me, let him do me justice!
To the king, my lord: your servant Balasî. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the crown prince about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me: " I have been told that he should not go outdoors on the 1st day" — this applies (rather) to the 2nd day.
Concerning the 1st and the 4th days about which the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Which one is favourable?" — both are favourable. We call the 4th day a ' new day.' A new day has the same qualities as the beginning of a month; it is favourable.
As to what was said to the king: " On the 1st day he may not go outdoors", does the crown prince now go out of the outer gate? Said the king: " The crown prince should enter into my presence." What has entering to do with going out?
Concerning Aššur-mukin-paleya about whom the king, my lord, spoke — the 4th day is good, let him come.
The planet Mercury (signifies) the crown prince, and it is bright, clothed with brilliance. (So) in view of what should he not come?
The moon completed the day in this month.
To the king, my lord: your servant Balasî. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the interpretation of the omen about which the king, my lord, wrote to me: " (It is said that) the king will be vilified amongst his magnates — what losses will ensue?" —
interpretations of monthly omens are like this: one is never similar to another, their interpretations go separately.
Now this one: if he will be slighted, its explanation can only be the earthquake. It has quaked: that is bad. They should perform the ritual against the earthquake, your gods will (then) make (the evil) pass by. " Ea has done, Ea has undone." He who caused the earthquake has also created the apotropaic ritual against it.
Was there no earthquake in the times of the king's fathers and grandfathers? Did I not see earthquakes when I was small? The god has (only) wanted to open the king's ears: " He should pray (literally ' open his fists') to the god, perform the apotropaic ritual and be on his guard."
To the king, my lord: your servant Balasî. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the crown prince about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me: " The planet Mars is bright" — (true), Mars will be clothed with brilliance right into the month Iyyar (II); (so) when is it that he (= the crown prince) can come into the presence of the king?
When Mars is bright, have we got no profit from it? He will not return to the area of Subartu; he will not go outside, either. There is nothing (wrong) — he will come into the presence of the king within the palace. What is wrong?
If it does not suit the king this month, the moon will complete the day in the month Nisan (I), the beginning of the year. Let him come into the presence of the king in Nisan!
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Why have you not sent an answer to (my) letter?" —
I had to drive to the palace those rams which the chief cook had brought forth for me, and the writing-board was in my house. Now then, I can look at the board and extract the relevant interpretation.
Concerning the ritual against the earthquake ...
I will read ....
To ... the ritual installations for Ea and Asalluhi, this is the appropriate way.
They did not tell me about the charge of the house of Urad-Daguna, when I was there; now, however, I have entered (the house) and examined (his) flesh. Is there a child who does not behave in this way (sometimes)?
Now, if it pleases the king, my lord, I will go and see him (again) tomorrow; I would return for the ritual.
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Aššur, Mullissu, Sin, Šamaš, Adad, Marduk, Zarpanitu, Nabû, Tašmetu, Ištar of Nineveh, Ištar of Arbela, Ninurta, Gula(!), Nergal and Laṣ, the great gods of heaven and earth and the great gods dwelling in Assyria and Akkad very greatly bless the king, my lord!
May they give happiness and health, extended days, fullness of life and a reign of prosperity to the king, my lord! May they grant the king, my lord, name and seed, offspring and progeny. May your countenance flourish and make my shelter wide!
As to what the king, lord of kings, my lord, wrote to me: " May your heart become happy now, may your mind no longer be restless" — after this friendly speech and this kind deed that is gratifying to god and man alike, that the king, my lord, has done, could I ever again get restless and depressed?
The king, my lord, has treated his servants as a father treats his sons; ever since mankind has existed, who is the king that has done such a favour for his servants, and what friend has returned a kindness in such a manner to his friend? May the great gods of heaven and earth in the very same way do a kindness and favour for the descendants of the king, my lord, as long as heaven and earth exist!
When I heard this friendly speech and saw the kind deed that the king, my lord, had done, my heart became happy and grew as strong as a bull's, and my green face turned red (with pleasure). If only the king, my lord, let's me grow old in exactly this way during the eternal life of the king, my lord!
May I die at my time according to how loyal I have been to the king, my lord. May the king, my lord, send word that just as Dadâ was ' harvested,' so may I be ' harvested.' May the king, my lord, in the same way give guidance to my sons, and may he see their grandchildren grow old!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " I have gathered you, your nephews and your cousins, you belong (now) to my entourage" — may Aššur together with his family, Bel and Nabû together with their families, and the great gods of heaven and earth together with their families in the same way gather the name and seed, offspring, descendants and progeny of the king, my lord, and let them stay in their entourage! As long as heaven and earth exist, may they be commanders of the whole world! How fine, how good, how choice, how correct, how full of love is what the king, my lord, has done!
The king, my lord, has drawn a plan, erected a stele and displayed it to (all) the people!
Concerning Nergal-šarrani and his brother Nabû-nadin-šumi about whom the king, my lord, gave me orders, I have hearkened to it ten times with all my ability.
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the substitute king about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me: " How many days should he sit (on the throne)?" —
we waited for a solar eclipse, (but) the eclipse did not take place. Now, if the gods are seen together on the 15th day, he may go to his fate on the 16th.
Alternatively, (if) it is agreeable to the king, my lord, let him complete the 100 days.
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me, we are working sleeplessly and unremittingly. If we did not work sleeplessly (now), what other work would there be for us to do? As far as this is concerned, the king, my lord, can be happy.
To the ' farmer,' our lord: your servant(s) Adad-šumu-uṣur and Urad-Ea. Good health to the ' farmer,' our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the ' farmer,' our lord!
We have rites to perform tonight: I shall perform one against " Loss of Flesh," and Urad-Ea another one before Enlil. We shall go to the qirsu.
Yesterday I performed the ritual of Bīt rimki. I made a burnt-offering and we executed a purification ritual.
I have appointed an exorcist for the chanter who is here, and gave him the following orders: " For six days do likewise, performing the purification ritual after this (fashion)."
To the ' farmer,' our lord: your servants Adad-šumu-uṣur and Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless our lord!
Concerning the 15th day about which our lord said: " Let the substitute king go to his fate and let me perform my ritual on the 16th day as before" — the 16th is a good day to perform (the ritual).
As our fathers did for their lords, and (as) the ' farmer' has already done once and twice, (while) Bel and Nabû provided well-being, just so let us also do now. Why should we wait as if it were not auspicious?
And as even the apprentices say: " It is recorded as favourable in Inbu bēl arhi," just so we shall keep it. Hence the 16th day is among the good days and is good, (whereas) the 17th day is not good.
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The charge of the rear palace is well.
Concerning the bile which the king, my lord, wrote that he has vomited, it is ...
He vomited a lump, (with) the bile settling downward; this sort of it does not portend good. (However), having purged upward and downward, he has (now) been sweating for two days, and is well. The king, my lord, can be glad.
To the king, our lord: your servants Adad-šumu-uṣur and Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to the king, our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, our lord!
As to the people about whom the king, our lord, wrote to us: " Can you not specify which (of them) are to come out?" —
Those who have not performed (the ritual) should come out tomorrow and perform it. The king, our lord, knows who has performed it and who has not; whence would we know?
May Bel and Nabû indicate (the right persons) in the shadow of the king, and let them come forth and perform (the ritual).
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Is this month good? The crown prince should visit me — when would it be good?"
In case he is accompanying the king to the Inner City, Shebat (XI) is a good month and the 17th is a good day. Let the crown prince enter into the king, my lord's presence
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-nadin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk greatly bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the ritual against the rābiṣu (demon) about which the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Perform it" — I performed it on the 13th day. I have fastened together all the paraphernalia of the ritual which I had made, sealed them and handed them over to a guardsman.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-nadin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk greatly bless the king, my lord!
Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Write me what the treatment is",
it is said in the relevant apotropaic ritual text (as follows):
" He (the king) sits 7 days in a reed hut, and purification rites are performed upon him; he is treated like a sick person.
During the 7 days ' hand-lifting' prayers before the nighttime deities and the apotropaic ritual against evil of any kind are performed as well, and the seven days he sits in the reed hut, he recites benedictions for his god and his goddess." Thus (is it).
Perhaps the king will say, " Perform it today" — the 8th day is suitable for performing it.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi. The best of health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May Ištar of Arbela give happiness and health to the king, my lord! May she sate the king, my lord, with old age and fullness of life! May she present the king, my lord, with long-lasting days!
At present I am continuously performing the ritual; and I have the (items for the) king's funeral burning collected in a storehouse in the Inner City.
Concerning those women about whom the king, my lord, spoke, the house where they are lodged is not suitable for eating, drinking and anointing the head, they being very many and staying there together. (So) if it suits the king, they should be (re)settled in the original place.
Alternatively, if we can perform the ritual by the 14th day, they may also go out to the river. Let the king, my lord, write to his servant how it is appropriate for us to perform the ritual, and for them to go where (they are) to go, and we shall do accordingly.
Also, what are the king, my lord's instructions concerning that female servant who is with them? Should the ritual be performed for her together with them?
Or no ...
until the king ...
if ......
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi. The best of health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the white clothes about which my lord wrote to me: " How many days should I wear them?" — the king should wear them on the 20th and the 21st; two days are enough. On the 22nd he can gird himself (again).
The king, my lord should (then) resume his normal activities.
Concerning the writing of the king, my lord, Kenî will die of envy when he sees it; Bel and Nabû have given a fine hand to the king, my lord. Yesterday I made an excuse for (its) not being seen; now I have made a quick commentary to it.
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-šumu-ereš. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The 20th, the 22nd and the 25th are good days for concluding the treaty. We shall undertake (that) they may conclude it whenever the king, my lord, says.
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-šumu-ereš. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Does (the omen) ' (If something) passes between the legs of a man' apply to something that came out from underneath a chariot?" — it does apply.
The king, my lord, says: "' The legs of a man' (means) ' legs' (only) when (something literally) emerges between a man's (legs); that mongoose passed between ..." — perhaps ...
We still take it as a portent. The mongoose passed from the left to the right and emerged from underneath the chariot. As for ' the legs of a man' about which the king, my lord, spoke, this is the relevant interpretation:
If a mongoose passes between the legs of a man, the hand of a god or the hand of a king will seize him.
Let us say ' mercy' for the Nabataeans. Why? — Are they not hostile kings? They will not submit beneath the chariot of the king, my lord!
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-šumu-ereš. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The scribes of the cities of Nineveh, Kilizi and Arbela (could) enter the treaty; they have (already) come. (However), those of Assur have not (yet) come. The king, my lord, knows that they are clergymen;
If it suits the king, my lord, let the former who have (already) come, enter the treaty; the citizens of Nineveh and Calah would be free soon and could enter (the treaty) under (the statues of) Bel and Nabû on the 8th day.
Alternatively, (if) the king, my lord, orders, let them go, do their work, and get free (again); let them reconvene on the 15th, come here and all enter the treaty in the said place at the same time.
However, it is written as follows in the hemerologies of the month Nisan (I): " He should not swear on the 15th day, (or else) the god will seize him." (Hence) they should enter the treaty on the 15th day, at dawn, (but) conclude it only in the night of the 16th day before the stars.
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Nanaya. The very best of health to the king, my lord! May Ninurta and Gula give happiness and physical well-being to the king, my lord!
The king, my lord, keeps on saying to me: " Why do you not diagnose the nature of this illness of mine and bring about its cure?" — formerly I spoke to the king at the audience and could not clarify his symptoms. Now I am sealing and sending a letter; it should be read to the king, to inform the king, my lord. If it suits the king, my lord, let the haruspices perform an extispicy on account of this.
Let the king apply this lotion (sent with the letter), and perhaps this fever will leave the king, my lord. I have prepared this lotion of oil for the king, my lord, (already) 2 or 3 times — the king knows it. If the king prefers, he may apply it tomorrow. It will remove the illness.
When they bring the ṣilbānu-medication to the king, let them draw the curtain as they have done once and twice (before); I will enter and give instructions. Perhaps the king will sweat.
In a bag, I am sending certain phylacteries to the king, my lord. The king should put them around his neck.
I am also sending a salve. The king should anoint himself on the day of his (acute) period (of illness).
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Nanaya. The very best of health to the king, my lord! May Ninurta and Gula give happiness and physical well-being to the king, my lord!
The baby is much better. I fastened an absorptive dressing on this abscess behind his ear, it rested loosely against its tip.
Yesterday evening I opened the lint by which it was attached and removed the dressing on it. There was pus as much as the tip of (one's) little finger on the dressing.
By your gods, nobody had laid hands upon it — he gave his word (for it). He is very well; the king, my lord, can be glad. He will be cured in 7 or 8 days.
To the king, our lord: your servants Nabû-ahhe-eriba and Balasî. Good health to the king, our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, our lord!
Concerning the tiara about which the king, our lord, wrote to us, the eye-stones which were shown to us are very beautiful. May Nabû, the lord of the world, bless the king, our lord, and lengthen the days of the king, our lord! May Nabû let the king, our lord, see the crown prince and his brothers prosper.
As to what the king, our lord, wrote to us: " There is more obsidian" — if ' eyes' are lacking, eye-stones should be made of it, and if a šanduppu (ornament) is lacking, a šanduppu-gem should be made of it. If it is extra, they may leave it unused.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-ahhe-eriba. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the sunrise about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, it is said (in the tablets) as follows:
If the glow of the day is like smoke, Adad will cause destruction in the springtime.
If the day is gloomy and rides the north wind: devouring by Nergal, the cattle will diminish.
The day (means) the sun.
Tomorrow we shall not see the sun when it sets: it will set amidst a reddish glow.
Dust storms whirled.
(That is why) it is clothed with redness.
I shall see what else there is and write to the king, my lord.
The radiance of the sun diminished in the path of the Anu stars. (This means) evil for Elam.
It is said as follows: (If) the sun rises in the path of the Anu stars and there is a reduction of its radiance, the appointed time has arrived; misfortune befell Elam in the morning.
" In the path of the Anu stars" (means) it is evil for Elam.
In the morning, during the sunrise, the south wind blew. Now the north wind is blowing.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-ahhe-eriba. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the arrangement of the (divine) ' party' about which the king, my lord, wrote to me — (according to the menologies) " (If) he wants to take the cult ceremonies," it is favourable in this month; it is favourable to arrange the ' party.' Let them arrange it on the 13th, 15th, (or) the 17th day.
Concerning the offerings about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, it is favourable to make them this month. Let them make them tomorrow (or) the day after tomorrow, whenever it (best) suits the king, my lord.
Concerning Aššur-mukin-paleya about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me — he may come, it is favourable to come. May the king, my lord, (live to) lift his grandsons upon his knees! (Nevertheless), they should be on the alert along the roadside and guard him (well).
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-ahhe-eriba. Good health to the king, my lord! (Since) this is a gloomy day, I did not send the (introductory) blessing.
The eclipse swept from the east(ern quadrant) and settled over the entire west(ern quadrant of the moon).
The planets Jupiter and Venus were present during the eclipse, until it cleared. With the king, my lord, (all) is well; it is evil for the Westland. Tomorrow I shall send the king, my lord, a (full) report on (this) eclipse of the moon.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The father of the king, my lord, gave me 10 homers of cultivated land in Halahhu. For 14 years I had the usufruct of the land, and nobody disputed it with me. (But) now the governor of Barhalzi has come and mistreated the farmer, plundered his house and appropriated my land.
The king, my lord, knows that I am a poor man, that I keep the watch of the king, my lord, and am guilty of no negligence within the palace. Now I have been deprived of my field. I have turned to the king; may the king do me justice, may I not die of hunger!
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-nadin-apli, the foreman of the collegium of ten scribes of Arbela. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
We kept watch on the 29th day; the place of observation was cloudy, we did not see the moon.
Month of Adar (XII), 1st day, eponym year of Sagab (651)
To the king, my lord: your servant Akkullanu. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The golden plate which disappeared from the Aššur temple has been seen in the hands of the stonecutter Qurdî-Nergal. Now the gold was for his eyes (i.e., meant for him). I am going to question the scribe now.
Let the king write again, and let them question him. The king should not write to Ṭab-šar-Sin, (for) he has been bribed by him. Instead let them question him as well: " To whom have you given bribes? Make up for the gold!"
The king should not let this pass over in silence. Let them at the same time question (all those) who have enjoyed gifts at the expense of the Aššur temple.
To the king, my lord: your servant, the foreman of the collegium of ten (scribes) of Arbela. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
An eclipse (of the moon) occurred on the 14th of Sivan (III), during the morning watch.
This is a continuation of the words of the previous letter.
May the rule of the king, my lord, be as pleasant as water and oil upon the peoples of all the countries! May the king, my lord, be their shepherd for ever!
I, (nothing but) a dog, blessing the king, his lord, have blessed the king, my lord (with) these blessings. May the gods whose names I have invoked, accept and hear them, and grant these blessings to the king, my lord, a thousandfold!
And may I, blessing the king, my lord, stand before the king, my lord, and revere (him) wholeheartedly with my arms (lifted in the gesture of blessing); and when my arms become weary, may I use up my strength with my elbows.
Who does not love his benefactor?
In a song from Babylonia it is said: " On account of your sweet words, O my shepherd, all the masters yearn for you."
To the king, my lord: your servant Mar-Issar. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May the great gods bestow long days, well-being and joy upon the king, my lord!
Damqî, the son of the prelate of Akkad, who had ruled Assyria, Babylon(ia) and all the countries, died with his queen on the night of the xth day as a substitute for the king, my lord, and for the sake of the life of Šamaš-šumu-ukin. He went to his fate for their redemption.
We prepared the burial chamber. He and his queen were decorated, treated, displayed, buried and wailed over. The burnt-offering was made, all portents were cancelled, and numerous apotropaic rituals, Bīt rimki and Bīt salā' mê ceremonies, exorcistic rites, penitential psalms and omen litanies were performed to perfection. The king, my lord, should know (this).
I have heard that before these ceremonies a prophetess had prophesied, saying to the son of the prelate, Damqî: " You will take over the kingship!" The prophetess had also said to him in the assembly of the country: " I have revealed the polecat, the ... of my lord, and placed (him) in your hands." These apotropaic rituals which were performed succeeded well indeed; the king, my lord, can be glad.
The inhabitants of Akkad got scared, (but) we gave them heart and they calmed down. Moreover, I have heard that the prelates and delegates of Babylonia got scared, too.
Bel and Nabû and all the gods have lengthened the days of the king, my lord; still, during the (validity) period of the eclipse and the approach of the gods he may not go into open country.
If it suits the king, my lord, a common man should, as before, be appointed to the office of the prelate, to present the regular offerings in front of the dais and, on the day of the eššešu-festival and at the " Greeting of the temple" ceremony, to strew (the incense) for the Lady of Akkad on the censer.
When an eclipse afflicting Babylonia takes place, he may serve as a substitute for the king, my lord, and stand ....... The ... s of the king, my lord, would succeed, ...... the people would be calm.
Let the king, my lord, appoint in his place anyone ...... who is acceptable to the king, my lord, among his ... s, brothers, and ... s.
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The prince NN is doing very, very well; the fever has left him.
The god has stood in the prayer bowl of the king — the king, my lord, should have himself shaved this (very) day.
Šamaš-šumu-ukin is doing well. We shall perform (the ritual entitled) " A substitute to Ereškigal" for the crown prince; we need not perform it for Šamaš-šumu-ukin at the same time. What is it that the king, my lord, orders?
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-naṣir. May Nabû and Marduk greatly bless the king, my lord!
Aššur-mukin-palu'a is very well; the king, my lord, can be happy.
We have begun to perform the rites of the month Elul (VI): " On the 16th you set a table made of tamarisk wood before Sin. At the head of the bed you place a censer of juniper for (the dream god) Zaqiqu. You wash his hands and feet with siderites and cassia. You bind lumps of salt, cassia, juniper, and lumps (taken) from the outer door to the hem of his garment."
By the gods of the king, my lord, the baby has not been with Aššur-mukin-palu'a. Until Aššur, Bel and Nabû, your gods, reckoned him among the (grown-up) people, we did not leave a day or month without rituals and rites.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Aššur, Šamaš, Bel, Zarpanitu, Nabû, Tašmetu, Ištar of Nineveh and Ištar of Arbela bless the king, my lord, a hundred years! May they appoint a guardian of health and life for the king, my lord! May they sate the king, my lord, with old age and fullness of life! May they keep firm the foundations of the royal throne of the king, my lord, until far-off days! May they let the king, my lord, see Assurbanipal and his brothers prosper! May the king lift their grandchildren into his lap! May the king constantly see their mental and physical well-being!
Concerning the order which the king, my lord, gave me, I wrote every word on a tablet; they said it to me word for word as the king, my lord, had said with his own mouth, it is safe.
Now, if she — as the king, my lord, says — comes to Calah, let them send Ahuni to pick up and bring (the tablets), so she can ' cast the solvents.'
As for myself, I am presently collecting all the 30 to 40 canonical tablets that are relevant to the matter, as well as (all) the existing non-canonical ones that are ever performed (in this connection).
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Nanaya. The very best of health to the king, my lord! May Ninurta and Gula give happiness and physical well-being to the king, my lord!
Concerning the cure of the ears, all the preparations have been made, (but) the king did not even begin with it yesterday. Let him now carry it out today.
Concerning the potion about which I said in the presence of the king ......
Let him carry out these cures of the ears today.
(As) the king, my lord, knows, the ilku-duty (of the physicians) is tomorrow. A ' third man' is saying: " I am under orders; the physician should come with me!" I am afraid; without (the permission of) the king I will not go
Alternatively, a physician who ...... mūṣu-stone may go with him.
May Nabû and Marduk bless the king!
A certain Akkullanu has written: " The sun made an eclipse of two fingers at the sunrise. There is no apotropaic ritual against it, it is not like a lunar eclipse. If you say, I'll write down the relevant interpretation and send it to you."
To the king, my lord: your servant Mar-Issar. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May the great gods bestow long days, well-being and joy upon the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Itti-Marduk-balaṭu of Uruk has written to me: ' Gold has accumulated in the temples, and there is repair work to be done'" —
formerly, before the king, my lord, went to Surmarrate, the king, my lord, asked me in Calah: " What work on the gods is incomplete?" I (then) informed the king, my lord, as follows:
" The decoration of Nanaya is incomplete. Furthermore, (while) the face and the hands of Uṣur-amatsa have been overlaid with gold, the figure and the feet have not. She is dressed with a lamahuššû-robe and equipped with a golden tiara. The two golden dragons are ready and they stand right and left upon her pedestal. I have sent her from Assyria to Uruk.
" Furthermore, the work on Arkayitu, Anunitu and Palil of the temple of Mummu: the carpenter's and metalworker's work is finished, (but) they have not been overlaid with gold. We have given them silver, (but) they are still to get gold from me.
" After we have finished the work on Uṣur-amatsa and on the temple of Mummu, and the temple is complete, then we shall make the decoration of Nanaya."
Now there are 40 minas of gold available. (However), the prelate, the delegate and the temple scribe of Uruk are visiting the king, my lord; without their presence I have no authority to check the gold. When they return, I shall go to Uruk. If extra gold has come in, I shall check it in their presence. I shall also see what repair work there is and send a detailed report to the king, my lord, concerning the gold and the repair work about which the prelate Itti-Marduk-balaṭu wrote to the king, my lord: " Let them turn the gold over to me, and let me do as I please."
Then the temple of Der: from the moment its foundations were laid, until now, the prelate and the officials of Der have been pushing it onto each other, and nobody has set about it. This year they have started to build, (but) one day they do the work, the next day they leave it.
I have heard that the crown prince of Elam has become troublesome and sent mud-brick masons there.
Der is situated on the border of another country. If it pleases the king, my lord, let a bodyguard and an Assyrian master-builder go and live there. Let them perform the work on the temple and establish the name of the king, my lord, forever. The king, my lord, should not neglect the guard of the temple.
And (finally), Mars has emerged from Scorpius and directed its course towards Sagittarius. The king, my lord, should know (this).
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-naṣir. May Nabû and Marduk
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-šumu-ereš. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Why have you never told me the truth? When will you (actually) tell me all that there is to it?" — Aššur, Sin, Šamaš, Bel, Nabû, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Mercury, Mars, Sirius and ... be my witnesses that I have never untruly
...... the word
... to the king, my lord
...... signs which have occurred in the sky
...... Jupiter
...... backwards
...... years before us
...... has entered... a thousand times.
When the planet Mars comes out from the constellation Scorpius, turns and re-enters Scorpius, its interpretation is this:
If Mars, retrograding, enters Scorpius, do not neglect your guard; the king should not go outdoors on an evil day.
This omen is not from the Series; it is from the oral tradition of the masters.
When Mars, furthermore, retrogrades from the Head of Leo and touches Cancer and Gemini, its interpretation is this:
End of the reign of the king of the Westland.
This is not from the Series; it is non-canonical. This aforesaid is the only area which is taken as bad if Mars retrogrades there. Wherever else it might retrograde, it may freely do so, there is not a word about it.
And the matter of the planet Jupiter is as follows: If it turns back out of the Breast of Leo, this is ominous. It is written in the Series as follows:
If Jupiter passes Regulus and gets ahead of it, and afterwards Regulus, which it passed and got ahead of, stays with it in its setting, someone will rise, kill the king, and seize the throne.
This aforesaid is the only area which is taken as bad if Jupiter retrogrades there. Wherever else it might turn, it may freely do so, there is not a word about it. Perhaps it was about this that the servant of the king, when (still) alive, and I spoke in the presence of the king, my lord. Saturn will ' push itself' this very month. (But) there is definitely not a word about it anywhere.
And as to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Watch whither ..." — I shall watch and write to the king, my lord, whatever it may be.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-tabni-uṣur. The very best of health to the king, my lord! May Ninurta and Gula very greatly bless the king, my lord! May Bel and Nabû give long-lasting days, many years, an eternal throne, happiness and physical well-being to the king, my lord!
If the king, my lord, knows a fault committed by me, let the king not keep me alive!
... last year they said: " Let me give ...," and they gave ... to all .... Nabû-tartiba-uṣur, an associate of mine, got the iron ... of the crown prince, (but) I did not get it.
(While) all my associates are happy, I am dying of a broken heart. I have been treated as if I did not keep the watch of the king, my lord; my heart has become startled indeed, panic has seized me, I have become exceedingly afraid: may the king revive my heart vis-à-vis my colleagues!
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk, and the great gods of heaven and earth very greatly bless the king, my lord!
The mother of the king is doing very well indeed; the king, my lord, can be glad indeed.
The ritual " Sick ..."; the incantation " Ea, Šamaš, Asalluhi" of (the ritual) " Nullifying the Curse"; the incantation " You, River, Creator of Everything" — she has performed (these) 10 tablets together with their rituals, and is very well. The king, my lord, can be glad indeed.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-nadin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the ritual about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, they should perform the exorcistic ritual exactly as the king has done once and twice already.
Concerning the injunctions about which the king wrote to me, the king should observe the injunctions carefully. " The king does not eat anything cooked; the king wears the clothes of a nurse."
The day after tomorrow the king will go down to the river; the king will perform his ritual as he has done already once and twice.
To the king, my lord: your servant Akkullanu. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May they give you the best of health as well as physical well-being!
Jupiter stood behind the moon; here is the relevant interpretation:
If Jupiter stands behind the moon: there will be hostility in the land.
Oh king, my lord, this is a matter concerning us. This sign pertains to the king, my lord. It means evil for Subartu. Presently I am waiting for the occultation and will look up the word about it; if it enters the moon, I shall send the relevant interpretation to the king, my lord.
But now, perhaps the king, my lord, does not believe (me)! The back of the moon should be shown to a eunuch who has a sharp eye: there is less than a span left to close. He should stand in shadow to observe — the king, my lord, will soon believe me.
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Nanaya. The very best of health to the king, my lord! May Ninurta and Gula give happiness and physical well-being to the king, my lord!
The crown prince is doing very well. As I visited the crown prince, the crown prince told me: " All my flesh has become well." The king, my lord, can be glad.
Subsequently I am sending off (an assortment of) drugs for fumigation. The kanaktu and nikiptu oil which I dispatched should be first dripped into the ear, thereafter let them do the fumigation. As soon as they have fumigated, they should repeat (the procedure), drip the rest of the oil upon (a tuft of) red wool and insert it into the ear. It is very efficient.
At the moment I am busy with cooking the beryl. In the ... of the beryl-stone ......
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-naṣir. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The charge of the ' Lady of Cults' is well.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Write me truthfully" — I am speaking the truth to the king, my lord.
The ' burning' wherewith his head, arms and feet were ' burnt' was because of his teeth: his teeth were (trying) to come out. Because of that he felt burnt and transferred it to his innards.
Now he is very well and has fully recovered.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû'a. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the watch about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, we shall keep it and write (to the king).
(The prince) NN is doing well; the king, my lord, can be happy.
As to what the king wrote to me: " Adjure Adad-šumu-uṣur! Why did he say that the crown prince and Šamaš-šumu-ukin should not go outdoors before the 22nd day of Tishri (VII)? Has he seen some portent?" —
I sent word, and he was adjured in the city of Akkad. He swore by the gods of the king: " I have seen no portent; (however), until he has completed the 100 days ..."
About the substitute king he said: " He should go to his fate on the 22nd of Tishri (VII)."
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Ea. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû, Marduk, Sin and Nikkal bless the king, my lord!
On the 25th day, at night, the kettledrum will be placed before Nergal upon the garments of the king. At the same time we shall perform the (chants) of Saturn. The god will bless the king, my lord, on account of the praise.
The crown prince explained it to my ... as follows:
" Aššur and Šamaš ordained me to be the crown prince of Assyria because of her (= the dead queen's) righteousness." (And) her ghost blesses him in the same degree as he has revered the ghost: " May his descendants rule over Assyria!"
Fear of the gods creates kindness, fear of the infernal gods returns life. Let the king, my lord, give the order
To the king, my lord: your servant Balasî. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the planet Venus about which the king, my lord, wrote to me: " I am told that it has become visible" —
the man who wrote (thus) to the king, my lord, is in (complete) ignorance. He does not know the ..., the cycle ..., (or) the (synodic) revolutions of Venus.
Venus is not yet visible. Tonight, as I am sending this message to the king, my lord, we see only Mercury; we do not see Venus. Presently it should be situated under Aries, in opposition to Saturn. Saturn (means) the star of the king.
The ignoramus — who is he? Perhaps this ... who wrote to the king, my lord, is in earnest.
We ......
until the first month ......
within one ......
the observation ......
of one ......
of another .......
Who is the man that writes so to the king, my lord? I repeat: he does not understand (the difference) between Mercury and Venus.
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Ea. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû, Marduk, Sin and Nikkal bless the king, my lord!
The kettledrum which the king, my lord, has established in his palace will be placed tonight before Marduk. He will bless the king, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant Mar-Issar. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May the great gods bestow long days, well-being and joy upon the king, my lord!
The substitute king, who on the 14th sat on the throne in Nineveh and spent the night of the 15th in the palace of the king, and on account of whom the eclipse took place, entered the city of Akkad safely on the night of the 20th and sat upon the throne.
I made him recite the omen litanies before Šamaš; he took all the celestial and terrestrial portents on himself, and ruled all the countries. The king, my lord, should know (this).
This eclipse which occurred in the month Tebet (X), afflicted the Westland; the king of the Westland will die and his country decrease or, according to another tradition, perish.
Perhaps the scholars can tell something about the (concept) ' Westland' to the king, my lord. Westland means the Hittite country (Syria) and the nomad land or, according to another tradition, Chaldea.
Someone of the kings of Hatti, Chaldea or Arabia will carry this sign. With the king, my lord, all is well; the king, my lord, will attain his desire, and the deeds and prayers of the king, my lord, are acceptable to the gods. The king of Kush, the king of Tyre, or Mugallu will die naturally, or the king, my lord, will take him captive; the king, my lord, will reduce his country, and his concubines will enter into the possession of the king, my lord. The king, my lord, can be glad.
Nevertheless, the king, my lord, should be on his guard and under strong protection. Apotropaic rituals, penitential psalms and rites against malaria and pestilence should be performed for the life of the king, my lord, and of my lords the princes.
Concerning NN about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me via Šarrat-samma-ila'i — in performing the zikurudāni-rites for him we once again invoked the name and performed it.
We are performing the treatment and the rites constantly and without fail.
To inspect Aššur-mukin-palu'a ...
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-ahhe-eriba. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
If it suits the king, the apotropaic ritual against evil of any kind should be performed, and the interpretation of the observation of Jupiter and Mercury which, in the same day, came forth in succession, should be written in (the text). It is said as follows:
" If the star of Marduk is black, in that year the asakku-disease will rage (in the country)."
They are at a distance and will keep away from each other; the king, my lord, should not be afraid of it. (The interpretation) should be written in the apotropaic ritual; anything that is pertinent should be done, and the evil should be made to pass by.
To the king, our lord: your servants Adad-šumu-uṣur, Nabû-mušeṣi and Issar-šumu-ereš.
Concerning the offerings for the goddess Šatru about which the king, our lord, wrote to us ...
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Is it good for Aššur-mukin-paleya to come up into my presence, and Sin-per'u-ukin to come up with him? Can the latter join him? They are (now) separated" —
let them come up together: Iyyar (II) is a good month, it has numerous good days. The foot of the god has gone to rest; it is (really) very auspicious to go (now) to the king, my lord.
The king, my lord, is the chosen one of the great gods; the shadow of the king, my lord, is pleasant for everything. Let them come up and run around in the sweet and pleasant shadow of the king, my lord. May the king, my lord, see them prosper, and may their grandchildren in like manner run around in the presence of the king, my lord!
The well-known proverb says: " Man is a shadow of god". But is man a shadow of man too? The king is the perfect likeness of the god.
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the substitute king of Akkad, the order should be given to enthrone (him).
Concerning the clothes of the king, my lord, and the garments for the statue of the substitute king, concerning the necklace of gold, the sceptre and the throne, ... bath
We shall begin with ... and enthrone (him) .... Now the order should be given, so we can ... and go. What is it that the king, my lord, commands?
To the great crown prince, the son of the king of the whole world, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the son of the king of all lands! May Aššur, Sin, Šamaš, Nabû and Marduk, and the great gods of heaven and earth very greatly bless the son of the king of all lands, my lord.
Because I was sent for, I have come now. The son of the king of all lands, my lord, can be happy.
To the king, our lord: your servants Adad-šumu-uṣur, Marduk-šakin-šumi and Nabû-nadin-šumi. Good health to the king, our lord! May Nabû and Marduk greatly bless the king, our lord!
Thereafter we shall perform it.
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
...... Sin-per'u-ukin
...... " Say in the presence of the king
... will recover; all the ... are weeping, ... will recover.
He said as follows: " The god told me, ' If you do not tell, you will die; and if you tell it to somebody belonging to the entourage of the king, and he does not make it known in the palace, he will die.'
" My mother was charged to go, (but) she did not tell (anything) in the palace. (Instead) she spoke in the presence of Bi... and his wife and sister. None of them told anything, and she and the others died."
Now that (the illness of) the king is being taken away, he (finally) spoke out to me, and I wrote to the king, my lord. Is it not said in the treaty as follows: " Anyone who hears something (but) does not inform the king ..."
Let them now summon him and question him!
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Aššur, Sin, Šamaš, Bel, Nabû and Nergal very greatly bless the king, my lord!
The sun did not make an eclipse, it passed by; Venus will reach Spica; the observation of Mercury is impending; there will be heavy rain and thunder. The king, my lord, should know (this).
Nobody has reminded (the king) about Urad-Gula, the servant of the king, my lord. He is dying of a broken heart, and is shattered (from) falling out of the hands of the king, my lord. The king, my lord, has revived many people.
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!

The king, my lord, can be happy.

May Aššur, Sin, Šamaš, Bel, Nabû, Nergal, Ištar of Nineveh and Ištar of Arbela call vigour, health, happiness, physical well-being and lasting days for the king, my lord!

As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Ask Bel-naṣir, Bel-ipuš and (other) Babylonians whom you know" — I asked them, and they said to me as follows: " An hour after sunrise, the display takes place; an hour and a half after sunrise, the display takes place again. Thereafter your burnt-offering is made; the display ...
Bel-ipuš said as follows: " When the display has been finished, two torches should be moved past the place where the king is staying, one to the right, one to the left, and (then) brought out. Alternatively, on the 5th day, when the king goes out, an exorcist should move a censer and a torch past (the king)."

Sivan (III) would have been a good month and the 17th a good day. (However) now the month is completely gone, (so) when can they do it?
Elul (VI) is a good month: it is (really) the month for it. During it they should make it, and also during it they should erect it.
To our lord: your servants Issar-šumu-ereš, Urad-Ea, and Marduk-šakin-šumi. The best of health to our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless our lord!

Concerning the substitute king about whom my lord wrote to me, Mars is emerging from the Breast of Scorpius ......
Concerning the signs about which my lord wrote to me, after we had enthroned him, we had him hear them in front of Šamaš. Furthermore, yesterday I had him hear them again, and I bent down and bound them in his hem. Now I shall again do as my lord wrote to me.
To the mother of the king, my lord: your servant Issar-šumu-ereš. Good health to the mother of the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the mother of the king, my lord!
May Mullissu bestow ... and give long-lasting days, happiness and joy ... to the king, the crown prince, and the progeny of the queen mother!
To the king, my lord: your servant Akkullanu. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The kanūnu will be in the evening.
To the king, my lord: your servant Akkullanu. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Mars has appeared in the path of the Enlil stars at the feet of Perseus; it is faint and of a whitish colour. I saw it on the 26th of Iyyar (II) when it had (already) risen high and I am subsequently sending the relevant interpretation to the king, my lord:
If Mars approaches Perseus, there will be a rebellion in the Westland; brother will slay his brother; the palace of the ruler will be plundered; the treasure of the country will go over to another country; the emblem of the country will be cast down; the king of the world will be delivered by his gods to his enemy."
This portends misfortune for the Westland. (I swear) by your gods, that Aššur, your god, will take away whatever dominance the Cimmerians have achieved and give it to the king, my lord.
If the strange star approaches the god Enmesarra, the country will be happy (and its) population will increase.
The strange star (means) Mars; (this portends) good fortune for the king, my lord.
If Mars lights up faintly and its glow is yellowish, the king of the Eastland will die in that year.
If, at his appearance, Nergal is small, whitish, and is very faint like a fixed star, he will have mercy on the land of Akkad; my armed forces will stand firm and slay the enemy, and the enemy army cannot stand before my army; the herds of Akkad will rest undisturbed in the pastures; sesame and dates will thrive; the gods will have mercy on the land of Akkad.
" If Mars becomes visible in the month Iyyar (II), there will be hostilities; destruction of the Umman-manda."
Umman-manda (means) the Cimmerians.
The solar eclipse which occurred in Nisan (I) did not touch the quadrant of Subartu. In addition, the planet Jupiter retained its position (in the sky); it was present for 15 more days. That is propitious.
If the sun rises in a nīdu, the king will get angry and raise his weapon.
Assyria is the land of Akkad of the king, my lord.
And concerning the rains which were so scanty this year that no harvest was reaped, this a good omen pertaining to the life and vigour of the king, my lord. Perhaps the king, my lord, will say: " Where did you see (that)? Tell me!" In a report sent by Ea-mušallim to his lord Marduk-nadin-ahhe it is written:
" If a sign occurs in the sky and cannot be cancelled, if it happens to you that the rains become scanty, make the king take the road against the enemy: he will conquer whatever (country) he will go to, and his days will become long."
If the moon becomes visible on the 30th of Sivan (III), the Ahlamû will consume the wealth of the Westland.
These are signs portending evil for the Westland. By Bel and Nabû, your gods, the enemy will fall into the hands of the king, my lord and ...... the defeat of enemy ......
To the king, my lord: your servant Akkullanu. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the emissaries of Bit-Kari
Let them bring me woolen garments and leather sandals; or shall I wear white clothes here? What is it that the king, my lord, says? I have only wanted to remind the king, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant Akkullanu. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
The king, my lord, will get angry and say: " Why did he ask me?" For the god's sake, on whom are his eyes fixed? Whom (else) would I ask?
To the king, my lord: your servant Balasî. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " You must certainly have observed something in the sky" — I keep a close eye on it (but) I must say, I have seen nobody and nothing, (therefore) I have not written to the king.
Not(hing) has risen; I have seen not(hing).
Concerning the watch of the sun about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, it is (indeed) the month for a watch of the sun. We will keep the watch twice, on the 28th of Marchesvan (VIII) and the 28th of Kislev (IX). Thus we will keep the watch of the sun for 2 months.
Concerning the solar eclipse about which the king spoke, the eclipse did not occur. I shall look again on the 29th and write (to the king).
The king, my lord, must have given up on me! With deep anxiety, I have nothing to report.
To the king, my lord: your servant Balasî. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord.
Concerning the tablet of Šumma izbu about which the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Look (at it)! Who would write ... in Šumma izbu?" — there is a particular tablet in which the ... s are written, and I am now sending it to the king. The king should have a look. Maybe the scribe who reads to the king did not understand.
Šumma izbu is difficult to interpret. The first time that I come before the king, my lord, I shall (personally) show, with this tablet that I am sending to the king, my lord, how the omen is written.
Really, the one who has not had (the meaning) pointed out to him cannot possibly understand it.

Akkullanu will read and explain the report on the lunar eclipse before the king.
To the king, our lord: your servants Balasî and Nabû-ahhe-eriba. Good health to the king, our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, our lord!
Concerning the planet Mercury about which the king, our lord, wrote to us: " I have heard it can be seen in Babylon" — he who wrote (this) to the king, our lord, may really have observed it. His eye, however, must have fallen on it.
We ourselves have kept watch (but) we have not observed it. One day it might be too early, another day it might lie flat (in the horizon). To see it, our eyes should (literally) have fallen on it.
To the king, our lord: your servants Balasî and Nabû-ahhe-eriba. Good health to the king, our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, our lord!

Three times I have sent salves, fumigants, phylacteries and potions to the king, my lord, but I do not know whether or not they have been brought to the king, my lord. I don't see an answer to my letter, nor do I hear about the health of the king, my lord.
When the king, my lord, was crown prince and went to ... Nabû'a, a fever lingered in (his) eyes just like in those of the king.
...... Kabtî
...... his efforts
... Marduk-šallim-ahhe
...... was low

Now ...... is low; ...... does not stay there. Do (all our) efforts really only result in regress?
Perhaps the king, my lord, will say: " The weather is hot." They may stay there as long as the king, my lord, finds appropriate.
Šamaš-šumu-ukin is doing much better; the king, my lord, can be glad. Starting from the 22nd day I am giving (him) blood to drink; he will drink it for 3 days. For 3 more days I shall give (him blood) for internal application. (Thanks to) Bel, Nabû and the Lady of Life, the flesh of Šamaš-šumu-ukin is much better.

Concerning Jupiter about which I previously wrote to the king, my lord: " It has appeared in the path of the Anu stars, in the area of Orion." —
it was low, and indistinct in the haze, (but) they said: " It is in the path of the Anu stars," and I sent the relevant interpretation to the king, my lord. Now it has risen and become clear; it is standing under the constellation Chariot in the path of the Enlil stars.
Its interpretation will remain the same, even if it ... to the Chariot. But the interpretation pertaining to Jupiter in the path of the Anu stars, which I previously sent to the king, my lord, is not valid. The king, my lord, should know this.
To the king, my lord: your servant Mar-Issar. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!

When the king, my lord, resettled the city of Akkad, he sent a sealed order to the deputy major-domo of Lahiru: " Deliver the regular offerings of the god! They should be advanced to Akkad!"

Concerning what the king, my lord, said about the clothes: " Where will the clothes be placed?" or about the people: " Why will the people be present?" — the clothes should be placed before Šamaš, and she should ' cast the solvents' upon them. A sacred woman will be there to perform a certain rite. The people should be present and perform their rituals. Thereupon an exorcist will take over.
Concerning the names about which the king, my lord, spoke, that in turn is my task. I shall bring up and say to her the name of the king, and the names of the crown prince and all his brothers, as many as there are sons, my lords, all (of them) ..., and she will pronounce them.
And ... ... the clothes of ... they should bring ...... as many as ......
...... we shall place them before Šamaš. The king my lord .......
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-ahhe-eriba. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
He who wrote to the king, my lord, " The planet Venus is visible, it is visible in the month Adar (XII)," is a vile man, an ignoramus, a cheat! And he who wrote to the king, my lord, " Venus is ... rising in the constellation Aries," does not speak the truth (either). Venus is not yet visible!
Why does one so deceitfully send such (a report) to the king, my lord? " Venus is stable in the morning": (this) signifies " morningtime." If ..., it signifies .... (But) Venus is not visible at present.
Who is this person that so deceitfully sends such reports to the king, my lord? Tomorrow they should let me scrutinize them, every single one of them.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " What do you take the present month to be?" — we take the present month to be Adar (XII), and the present day is the 27th; the coming month is Nisan (I).
Why does someone tell lies and boast about it? If he does not know, he should keep his mouth shut. The king, my lord, should not hesitate (but) promote him at once!
Venus is not yet visible.
If a star flashes and goes down in the east: an enemy host will attack the country, and the enemy will ravage the country.
If a star flashes in the daytime: there will be an enemy attack against the country, and the enemy will (victoriously) wander around in the country.
On the 29th of Iyyar (II), from sunrise until the day had advanced x hours, the radiance of the sun was diminished. Its interpretation is as follows:
If the sun rises and its light does not get stronger: Šamaš is angry with the king of the land.
If the sun is dark: the king of Akkad will die.
" Its radiance is diminished," variant: " it is dark" (means) there is no apotropaic ritual against it.
On the loss of radiance one has remarked: " It is not an eclipse, but loss of radiance is (even) more dangerous than an eclipse; its sign is extremely unlucky."
The planet Mars has gone on into the constellation Capricorn, halted (there), and is shining very brightly. The relevant interpretation is as follows:
If Mars rides Capricorn: devastation of Eridu; its people will be annihilated.
And the interpretation of the great brightness is as follows:
If Mars shines brightly: the king will gain in strength and prosperity.
If the effulgency of Mars is seen in the sky: there will be an epidemic, variant: an epidemy among the cattle of the country.
The enemy will never again ...... the ...; they are at peace with the king, my lord. The king, my lord, can be happy.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû'a. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
We kept the watch; on the 15th day the moon and the sun saw each other.
When he reveres the gods, it (the day) is good for praying.
The favourable days about which the king, my lord, spoke are: the 10th, the 15th, the 16th, the 18th, the 20th, the 22nd, the 24th and the 26th, altogether 8 days of the month Iyyar (II) which are good for undertaking an enterprise and revering the gods.

The 22nd: good for undertaking an enterprise;
To the king, our lord: your servants Balasî and Nabû-ahhe-eriba. Good health to the king, our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, our lord!
Concerning the trip to the city ..., about which the king, our lord, wrote to us — if the king stays indoors, it is good to go in Tishri (VII). Should the king, however, say: " I will not ...
As the king previously said, the present month is intercalary; the matter should be dropped. Let the king go, kiss the ground and perform the sacrifices in the coming month.
" Since the planet Venus is shining here, the time is opportune for my reverence."
The king, my lord, knows that the Venus rituals of the " overseer's wife" are performed ... the said ...; now then Venus has risen at the (very) time of its (computed) appearance. Today is favourable to do ...

To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû'a. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
We kept the watch on the 29th day; we saw the moon.

Now that the king, my lord, has said to me: " Again you ...; it should be explained!" Do I ... the work? They should explain it to the king, my lord. By Sin, lord of the crown, its meaning should be ...! I swear that it has been explained to the king, my lord, and that I do not conceal anything I hear and see from the king, my lord. If they are guilty of a ..., may your gods not hold me responsible!
May she give ... to the king, my lord!
As the king, my lord, was making his (triumphal) entry into the city of Arbela and heard about the conquest of the city of ...

May Ninurta and Gula bestow happiness and physical well-being on the king, my lord, and his seed!
And concerning the ritual (against) cultic evil about which the king, my lord, spoke, we are now making preparations (for it). The 2nd, the 6th, the 7th, the 9th, the 11th, the 13th, the 15th, the 18th, the 19th, the 20th, the 22 nd, the 24th, the 26th, the 28th and the 30th are auspicious days; the number of these good days is altogether 15.
We shall perform it tomorrow in the evening and on the night of the 11th day; ... which we are performing ...
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-nadin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May they give long-lasting days, ever-lasting years, happiness and physical well-being to the king, my lord! As heaven and earth last for ever, may the name of the king, my lord, last for ever in the land of Assyria!
There is much hatred in the presence of the king, my lord; let the king, my lord, heed the message of this letter!
The king, my lord, is a great benefactor and lover of his people. As Urad-Nanaya ......, the king, my lord, sent ... to him ...
Now he has touched his father's house
...... his servant stays in the presence of a palace eunuch.
I will find out whatever report there is and send the result of my efforts, a tablet meeting the king's desire, ... to the king, my lord.
..... Urad-Nanaya
May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May Aššur, Bel and Nabû bestow happiness and well-being upon the king, my lord!
The prince NN is doing very well. The king, my lord, can be happy.
Until ... the scribal craft ......
The king, my lord, knows that I am (a servant) whose eyes are fixed upon his lords, who prays to the gods for the happiness and well-being of his lords, and whose heart is fully dedicated to his lords. Even a dog ...... with its shepherd!
Now I and ......; to whom else would we be devoted? May Aššur, Bel and Nabû give the king, my lord, happiness and health!
Concerning the man who ...... did not open his mouth, we have ... ed on (his) behalf. If we had not asked, ..........
May good news of happiness and joy like this constantly reach the king, my lord!

To the king, my lord: your servant Mar-Issar. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May the great gods bestow lasting days, well-being and joy upon the king, my lord!
The tiara of Nabû is completed; the name of the king, my lord, and the name of the crown prince of Babylon, my lord, have been inscribed on it; the appropriate (dedicatory) ritual has been performed.
...... Meanwhile, ašgikû-jewels and ... were obtained (as booty) from Egypt.
In the springtime the king, my lord, sent a bodyguard to the commandant and the prelate of Borsippa (with the following orders): " Make an account of the bulls and sheep belonging to Nabû. Supply, as in olden times, the regular ram offerings from the estates of the citizens of Borsippa! The fattest rams should be delivered to Nabû!"
The shepherds have (however) bribed both the commandant and the prelate: up till now no account of the bulls and sheep has been made, nor have they supplied the regular ram offerings. They have not (even) sacrificed the king's offerings, the ungelded bulls, in the month Nisan (I), (but) do the bull herdsmen's bidding. They turn the blesser's ungelded bulls back from the (temple) gate, and have served (such bulls) on the table of Nabû.
Of the blesser's ungelded bull which was sacrificed before the god Nanaya, I have heard that its right-hand kidney was missing. All the citizens of Borsippa are complaining: " The bulls and sheep of Nabû are being concealed from the country!" Why do they leave the shepherds on the loose!
I have heard that one of the magnates, whom the shepherds have been associated with has said to the commandant of Borsippa: " The shepherds are plotting ......." The king, my lord, should know (this).
Perhaps they are telling the king, my lord: " In olden times, no accounts (of oxen and sheep) were made." (If so), they are lying. In an ordeal proverb attributed to Burnaburiaš, king of Babylon, it is said: " The (time of) accounting is the ordeal of the shepherds." I am dispatching the relevant tablet to the king, my lord.
The shepherds ... ever since the Chaldeans ......
...... the delegate
...... his testimony
...... the shepherds have become powerful.
The ... s have received bribes from ....
I became afraid of the punishment ...... and wrote to the king, my lord. Let the king, my lord, act as it is suitable to the king, my lord, and to his gods.
On the xth of Iyyar (II) the Lady of Akkad will set out (in procession) and take up her residence in the akītu-temple; many ... are coming to Akkad. The king, my lord, should know (this).
Furthermore, I heard in Babylon that ....... It had 5 kidneys. It is a good omen; the king, my lord, should know (this).
wrote "......."
There are ships lined up across the Borsippa river. In the days of Sargon and the father of the king, my lord, as the Borsippa river was narrow, they trod a ramp on them, (but) it did not stay in good condition. Now in the times of the king, my lord, the river has swollen much; they have improved the ramp, but it will not stay in good condition. Let the bridge of ships be kept as it is; when the king, my lord, comes, they will put in an improved filling, (so that) the king, my lord, can cross over it in his chariot.
This year the waters have increased and risen up to the wall of Ezida. There are oblates of Išum available; if it pleases the king, my lord, let them glaze kiln-fired bricks and brick up the quay-wall of Ezida and let me put the inscription of the king, my lord, therein. They should cut the waters off.
Concerning the wall of the Nergal temple of Cutha about which I wrote to the king, my lord:
If it pleases the king, my lord, let us build the temple of DN, ...... and let the inscription of the king, my lord, be put therein. However, let the king, my lord do as it pleases him.
The bodyguard Nergal-šarru-uṣur came with the deputy of the Lahirite (major-domo); they invoked the king's word, dismissed the delegates of the temples of Sippar, Cutha, Hursagkalama and Dilbat and appointed others. The king, my lord, should know this.
In the night of the 10th of Tammuz (IV), the constellation Scorpius approached the moon. Its interpretation is as follows:
If at the appearance of the moon Scorpius stands by its right horn: in that year locusts will rise and consume the harvest, variant: The king of Elam will be killed in that year, his reign will be brought to an end, and an enemy will attack and plunder the interior of his country.
For the king of Akkad: good luck. His reign will become long, and the enemy who attacks him will be defeated.
On the 10th of Tammuz (IV), Venus was visible in Leo:
The king of Akkad ... wherever ...
... in the land of Akkad ......
... in the land of Akkad ......
... now ......
... and dates ......
... but his messenger did not ......
... beyond the kingship of ......
... completed according to his word ...... with the king ...
I told him: " You will take over the kingship." Let the king create her ....
I am Bel-ušezib, your servant and your dog who fears you ....
Why did the king my lord summon prophets and prophetesses when I disclosed the many things I had heard in Nineveh, (while) I, who blocked the exorcist with my mouth and went to pay homage to the crown prince my lord, who evaded execution by fleeing to the Tower, whose murder along with your servants was plotted every day, and who told the omen of the kingship of my lord the crown prince Esarhaddon to the exorcist Dadâ and the queen mother, saying: " Esarhaddon will rebuild Babylon and restore Esaggil, and honor me" —
why has the king up until now not summoned me?
And when in the ... that went in the Tower this wonderful scheme, as I had predicted it to the crown prince, my lord, was realised and given to the king, my lord, so that it looked like a musician in his hands —
the gods of the king of lands, my lord, be my witnesses that I said to the king, my lord, that the king will rule all the countries and that the great gods will give many years to the king, my lord.
All these 20 years since I gave ... three talents of silver and ... audience gifts, they have not given me my ...; yet there are many audience gifts.
Let me resettle the ruined lands ... for the king, and let ... by the king's command.
In the reign of your royal father, Kalbu the son of Nabû-eṭir, without the knowledge of your royal father made a pact with the scribes and haruspices, saying: " If an untoward sign occurs, we shall tell the king that an obscure sign has occurred." For a period of time he censored all ... s, if a sign untoward to him occurred, and that was anything but good.
Finally, when the alû (demon) had come, he said: " If a sign that is untoward to me occurs and you do not report it to me, ......."
The scribes and haruspices took heed of these words, and by the gods of the king, they reported every portent that occurred during the reign of your royal father, and your royal father did stay alive and exercise the kingship.
Now then portents have occurred in the reign of the king, my lord, bearing upon him. They have set aside whatever ......; (but) where (are they)? They are looking for a pleasant sign ..., saying: " Keep evil omens to yourselves, let ......."
This was the sign of kingship: (If a planet comes close to a planet), the son of the king who lives in a city on my border will make a rebellion against his father, but will not seize the throne; a son of nobody will come out and seize the throne; he will restore the temples and establish sacrifices of the gods; he will provide jointly for (all) the temples.
Now then a sign has occurred in Iyyar (II), in the reign of the king, my lord ...
...... called a kingship of far-off days ......
...... the crown prince who was meant ......
...... the king came ......
... flees, let me stretch out my ...; who is the ... that ......?
... ... Esarhaddon ......
... you do not guard me ......
You are .... May the face of Šamaš guard you ......!
To the king, my lord: your servant NN. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk very greatly bless the king, my lord! May Aššur, Mullissu, Sin, Šamaš, Nabû and Marduk ... the king, my lord, in health and vigour, and may they bless that benevolent face! May Sin and Nikkal, with whom the king, my lord, has walked, give happiness, physical well-being, long-lasting days and everlasting years to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk ...... to the king, my lord!
Now the ... of the king, my lord, has discharged me, (though) my arms and legs have not yet become feeble!
May that benevolent face ...
What shall I do ...?
Should I praise this word by which the king, my lord, has remembered me?
A cross is the emblem of the god Nabû. The king, my lord, knows (that) because of this (association) the cross is the badge of the crown prince. The king, my lord, has now acted as befits his dignity: the emblem has been set up in the ' house of Išnunak.' About it they say: " It is the god Nabû (himself)."
Concerning the new tablets that are being written, the king has spoken as follows about us: "... the talk that is better than this ...; there is much space, there is much .... Assign some ten ... sentences and send them to me, I shall have a look." — ... I continually listen to what the king, my lord, has written to me.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Perhaps, now that they have set up the cross in my house, my word will be wiser" — on account of that you will speak a word that is as perfect as that of a sage; a word that has been spoken just as it is meant by its nature, by its ..., by its dignity, (that) suits the context, is (such a word) open to dispute? Does it not inspire awe? Is this not the very acme of the scribal craft of which I am arguing in this way? Should the talk be praised?
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Gula. The best of health to the king, my lord! May Marduk and Zarpanitu, Nabû and Tašmetu, Ištar of Nineveh and Ištar of Arbela, Ninurta and Gula, Nergal and Laṣ very greatly bless the king my lord, the just one! May they bestow long days and everlasting years upon the king, my lord!
May the great gods of Heaven and Earth constantly bless your kingship, may they love the pure sacrifices you offer and appreciate your priesthood, may they guard your steps and straighten your path, may they defeat your enemies, slay your foes, drive off your adversaries and pick up their possessions; may they make your leadership as beneficial as choicest oil to the totality of all nations; may they keep the foundation of your throne firm as a rock forever; may Šamaš, the light of Heaven and Earth, be receptive to a just verdict concerning you.
May the king, my lord, heed the case of his servant, let the king see the whole situation! Initially, in (the days of) the king's father, I was a poor man, son of a poor man, a dead dog, a vile and limited person. He lifted me from the dung heap; I got to receive gifts from him, and my name was mentioned among men of good fortune. I used to enjoy generous ' leftovers'; intermittently, he used to give me a mule or an ox, and yearly I earned a mina or two of silver.
In the days of my lord's crownprincehood I received ' leftovers' with your exorcists; I stood at the window openings, keeping watch; all the days that I spent in his service I guarded his privileges, I did not enter the house of a eunuch or a courtier without his permission. I was looked upon as one who eats lion's morsels, I appeased your god. Now, following his father, the king my lord has added to the good name he had established, but I have not been treated in accordance with my deeds; I have suffered as never before, and given up the ghost.
Improper conduct, whispering about and revealing a secret are detestable things; I guarded the privileges of the king my lord, but I did not find benefactors. I endured ... words, I made (my) office (my) night's resting place, I taught the servants, the non-eunuchs and eunuchs alike, submission, toil and fear of the palace, and what did I get for it?
If it is befitting that first-ranking scholars and (their) assistants receive mules, (surely) I should be granted one donkey; likewise, (as) oxen are apportioned in Tebet (X), I too should ... one ox!
Two or three times within a month three to four ... are given to ...;
even ... an apprentice of the assistant ... gets ... and enjoys a sheep ......; but me, what (compensation) do I draw, or for what purpose do I work?
I cannot look at the ...... of the king, nor ......
...... Day and night I pray to the king in front of the lion's pit ...... which ... are not ... with morsels ...... my heart amidst my colleagues ......
...... and likewise among my brothers ......
...... a medical potion, ointments ......
...... aren't ewes ...... in this manner?
......... I sent a letter to the king my lord through Šarru-nuri the eunuch; but I (only) heaped up the grief of my heart, writing to the king, my lord.
The very same evening ... the king sent a letter to his servant, saying " I did not know that you are having such a hard time; (for) I ...... did send for you." The word of the king my lord is as difficult as a mountain!
I placed the letter in safekeeping at the throne of Nabû and guarded it like (my) only son; (but) if my distress has in any way slackened, the king my lord should be very happy indeed. He should have remembered his servant, saying " Let him receive my necklace while I am looking on." There is another saying, too: " He who has been stabbed in the back has (still) got a mouth to speak, but he who has been stabbed in the mouth, how can he speak?"
It is two years now since the two beasts of mine died; I have walked three times to Arbela and once to the city of Assur, (but) who has showed me any compassion by taking me by the hand or leading me into the presence of the king my lord? Why did the king summon an exorcist from Ekallate, while I had to take to the back (lit. desert) roads because of people asking me: " Why do you go on foot?"
People pass my house, the mighty on palanquins, the assistants in carts, (even) the juniors on mules, and I have to walk!
Perhaps the king will say: " He is a citizen." The king can ask (anyone): My father portioned out 6 homers of field with his brother Nabû-zeru-lešir; I and my brother got three homers each, and in addition two souls! By the grace of the king my lord I have purchased 5 or 6 souls.
I have visited the Kidmuru temple and arranged a banquet, (yet) my wife has embarrassed me; for five years (she has been) neither dead nor alive, and I have no son. This year three women have fallen to me; but I have no farmer, no farm equipment, no farm. By Anu, Enlil and Ea who are firmly implanted in the head of the king, my lord, I cannot (even) afford a pair of sandals or the wages of a tailor, I have not got a spare suit of clothes, and I have incurred a debt of almost six minas of silver, plus the interest.
Also, I am 50? years (already) and they say: " Once you have reached old age, who will support you?" The king is not pleased with me; I go to the palace, I am no good; I turned to a prophet (but) did not find any hope, he was adverse and did not see much. O king my lord, seeing you is happiness, your attention is a fortune!
May the king's .... heart soften, and may he at least send me the two beasts, ........., and a spare suit of clothes! Guarding ........., for the crownprincehood of the king, my lord ...
The king my lord knows me since the time he was a child; I have (always) said: " No ...

who would see ...... and grasp his ... will not lift ......
... Epilepsy keeps attacking him all the day.
I prepared the stones and the phylactery (used) against epilepsy and put them upon him, (and see), the epilepsy left him.
Once the child had calmed down, they put (the amulets) upon the nephew of Zeru-ken: he, too, calmed down.
Once the nephew of Zeru-ken had calmed down, they put (the amulets) upon that shepherd — your sister .... He calmed down.

To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-naṣir. May Nabû and Marduk very greatly bless the king, my lord!
The charge of the ' Lady of Cults' is doing very, very well; the king, my lord, can be glad.
When the king, my lord, was in Tarbiṣu, I wrote to the king, my lord: " A good dream concerning the charge of the ' Lady of Cults' has been seen, I have heard his utterance."
Now he is doing very well; the gods have blessed the king, my lord.

Whatever old work there is, is full (weight) as if cast; (but) all the new stuff which has been manufactured recently is too thin.
The king, my lord, knows that the temple of Amurru collapsed and Amurru was moved into the temple of Anu. Now the temple of Amurru has been completely rebuilt. What is it that the king, my lord, orders?
To the king, my lord: your servant Nergal-šumu-iddina. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!

Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Is it favourable for the crown prince to come into the presence of the king?" — it is very favourable. The crown prince may come into the presence of the king, my lord, this (very) day.
May Bel and Nabû lengthen his days, and may the king, my lord, see him prosper! The month is good, this day is good: the planet Mercury (signifies) the crown prince, and it is visible in the constellation Aries; Venus is visible in Babylon, in the home of his dynasty (lit. father); and the moon will complete the day in the month Nisan (I). We count this together: it is propitious.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May they give happiness and physical well-being to the king, my lord!

Why is nothing done month after month? It is a fault! Something will certainly ensue from it! ...... Assyria ...
To the king, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
Concerning the planet Mars about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, does the king not know that it is ...? ... it moves towards the star Spica ... invasion of locusts ...
(Mars) is bright and clothed in brilliance; ... a bad omen for Subartu. We will remove those ....
We are constantly performing apotropaic rites and ' hand-lifting' prayers before Mars ... There is nothing to worry about; the king, my lord, can be at ease.
An order of the ' farmer' to Adad-šumu-uṣur and Marduk-šakin-šumi: I am well.
Speak again with the commander-in-chief (as follows): " Will you assume the responsibility fot the eclipse of the sun? Perhaps ..."
Surely there will be an eclipse of the sun? Send me definite word!
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-nadin-apli, the foreman of the collegium of ten (scribes) of Arbela. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû, Marduk, and Ištar of Arbela bless the king, my lord!
We kept the watch on the 29th day; the moon was seen.
May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
A lunar eclipse took place on the 14th of Sivan (III), during the morning watch. It started in the south (of the moon) and cleared up in the south. Its right side was eclipsed.
It was eclipsed in the area of the constellation Scorpius. The shoulder of the constellation Panther was culminating. An eclipse of two fingers (magnitude) took place.
... the stars Sirius, Antares, Vega — these are the former ones which have already been visible. The planet Mercury has not yet appeared.
... did not appear, and the day ....
Last year, it became visible on the 22nd of Iyyar (II) in the constellation Perseus; it disappeared in Nisan (I) of the present year, on the 29th day.
Jupiter may remain invisible from 20 to 30 days; now it kept itself back from the sky for 35 days. It appeared on the 6th of Sivan (III) in the area of Orion, exceeding its term by 5 days. The relevant interpretation is as follows:
If Jupiter appears in Sivan: destruction of the land will be brought about, barley will become expensive.
If Jupiter approaches Orion: the (pest) god will consume (the land).
If Jupiter enters into Orion: the gods will consume the land.
If Jupiter becomes visible in the path of the Anu stars: the crown prince will rebel against his father and seize the throne.
The path of the Anu stars (means) Elam; it pertains to to Elam. Nevertheless, they should (strengthen) the guard and perform the relevant apotropaic ritual.
Furthermore, when it had moved onwards 5 days, (the same amount) by which it had exceeded its term, it completed 40 days. The relevant interpretation runs as follows:
If Neberu drags: the gods will get angry, righteousness will be put to shame, bright things will become dull, clear things confused; rains and floods will cease, grass will be beaten down, (all) the countries will be thrown into confusion; the gods will not listen to prayers, nor will they accept supplications, nor will they answer the queries of the haruspices.
This interpretation I have extracted and sent to the king, my lord, (exactly) as it was written on the tablet.
... to Nineveh ...
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-nadin-apli, the foreman of (the collegium of) ten (scribes) of Arbela. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû, Marduk, and Ištar of Arbela bless the king, my lord!
We kept watch on the 29th; we did not see the moon.
Month of Marchesvan (VIII), 1st day, eponym year of Ahi-ila'i (649)
... will come out of captivity and inprisonment.
Naṣiru showed me thornbush; it resembles the shoot of a date palm about to burst out this very day, and at its tip it looks like a wire cable. ... it is a tree indigenous to Assyria; it also is a tree indigenous to Babylonia.

Perhaps the king, my lord, will say: "......." Venus is approaching the constellation Cancer; here is the relevant interpretation:
If the Goat star approaches Cancer: there will be peace and reconciliation in the country; the gods will have mercy on the country; empty storage bins will become full, the crops of the country will prosper; the sick of the country will recover; pregnant women will carry their foetuses to full term; the great gods will abandon the sanctuaries of the country; the temples of the great gods will be restored.
... is not ... for oppression .... For the god's sake, wherefore ...?
To the king, our lord: your servants Balasî and Bamaya. Good health to the king, our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, our lord!
The moon and sun appeared together on the 14th day.
Before we saw the king, our lord's letter, we kept watch, wrote a report, and gave it to .... He did not ...... mouth ..... we seized ....
Now then we shall watch the appearance (of the moon) in Tebet (X) and write to the king, our lord.
The bodyguard brought the letter on the 19th of Kislev (IX).
If the Pleiades flare up and go before Venus, in the morning ... the city will be encircled. (As) planet Pleiades is Mars.
We have finished writing the (tablet) breaking the good news. Maybe the king, our lord, has something left to say; (if so) we shall expand it by appending a second tablet.
To the king, my lord: your servant Mar-Issar. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May the great gods bestow long days, physical well-being and joy on the king, my lord.

The seal of Aššur, king of the gods; the seal of God the King, not to be contested.
I am Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria, circumspect monarch, the perfecter of the forgotten cult of Ešarra according to the oracular command of Šamaš and Adad, the enlarger of their purificatory cult, the restorer of the protective deity of Ešarra, which had ceased to function, to its place.
In Nisan (I), when at the New Year's Festival, on account of chaos and anarchy, Aššur was going to the festival banquet in a garden within the city;
at that time, after I had made the statue of Aššur, king of all the gods, the creator of himself, the father of the great gods, whose figure was exalted in the Abyss, king of heaven and earth, lord of all the gods, the progenitor of the Igigi and the Anunnaki, the builder of the roof of heaven and the basement of earth, the maker of all the regions, living in the pure starlit heavens, the foremost god, the one who decrees the destinies, the one who lives in Ešarra which is in Assur, the great lord, my lord,
and (after I had made) the statues of the great gods, with the clever understanding that Ea bestowed upon me, and with the wisdom that Aššur, king of the gods, had given unto me;
I pondered and on my own initiatve I performed an oracle query concerning the Akitu Temple of the steppe. Šamaš and Adad commanded me to build the Akitu Temple for the festival of Aššur, which is appropriate for his great divinity.
I took its foundations down until I reached the underground waters.
Of my own initiative I skillfully built it from the foundation to the parapet with mountain limestone and raised it as high as a mountain. I opened a canal and called its name " That which Purifies the New Year's Festival." I encircled it with trees of the orchard, all kinds of fruits and aromatic plants, as with a garland.

The king should do as he deems best.
As for what I said to the king, my lord, namely: " My money is in the possession of the ' Son of Dakuru,'" to which the king, my lord, then replied: " There is no sealed order. Let (one) come and you will receive your money from him."

The 3rd of Elul (VI) is the clothing (ceremony) of Bel; the 4th day is the grand opening of the gate. The king, my lord, knows (this).

About what I said to the king, my lord: " The 12 minas of gold which came in to me as gifts for Bel I have made into rosettes and ...-ornaments for Zarpanitu." I will now fashion the seals which the king, my lord, gave me. The gems going on the crown of Anu, and those gems of yours going on the sun disks are stored in the treasury of the temple of Aššur. No one can open (it) without the authority of the priest and Nabû-eṭir-napšati. I have now written to the king, my lord, that the king send me anyone whom the king, my lord, pleases to open (the treasury), so that I can finish (the work) and give it to the king, my lord.
I am the who blesses the king, my lord. I trust in the king, my lord. I pray to Marduk and Zarpanitu for the life, happiness, health, and longevity of the king, my lord. I must not become estranged from the king, my lord. Marduk-zeru-ibni is slandering me because he trusted Urdu-Nabû and Nadinu. I, (on the other hand,) trust in the king, my lord. May the eyes of the king be upon me.

To the king, my lord: your servant, Šamaš-šumu-lešir. Good health to the king, my lord. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord.
When the king, my lord, sent me to the Land of the Chief Cupbearer and gave fields to his servants, in that city to which I ascended, in one temple these six deities were dwelling: Marat-Sin of Eridu, Marat-Sin of Nemed-Lagudu, Marat-Eridu, Nergal, Amurru, and Lugalbanda.
The people there told me: " These gods came with the king's father from Issete. The king's father said: ' I will send them with Bel to Babylon.'"
No one has spoken about this to the king. They indeed came here with Bel.
Now if the king, my lord, (so) commands, let a royal messenger go, and let them bring these gods (there) and have them sent on their way. Why should they dwell here? I have written to the king, my lord, about what I have seen.
Unlike a servant of the king, on the day when I came here at the written order of the king, my lord, I did not even get an audience with the king, my lord. And I perish at my work, like a dog; I have not even entered the presence of the king, my lord.
Am I not your servant? O king, my lord, let me behold that beautiful face of yours. Why must I die for want of food? Like a dog, I bound about and roam around. I have no house, no maid, no servant. (If this is) the way the king, my lord, regards me, I am finished. O king, my lord, for what reason did you bring me here?

The 4th day of Iyyar (II), Nabû and Tašmetu will enter the bed chamber. At the beginning of your reign, I performed the sacrificial offerings before Nabû and Tašmetu which have given life to the king, my lord. Now then I am writing to the king, my lord:

I have given instructions about the offerings for Assurbanipal, the great crown prince, for Šamaš-šumu-ukin, the crown prince of Babylon, for Šeru'a-eṭerat, for Aššur-mukin-paleya, and for Aššur-etel-šame-erṣeti-muballissu.

The gold which the treasurer, the palace scribe, and I weighed in the month of Tishri (VII) — 3 talents of refined gold and 4 talents of unrefined gold — was deposited in the storeroom of the director of the royal storehouse. He sealed it and did not give any for the royal statues or the statue of the queen mother. The king, my lord, should issue an order to the treasurer and to the palace scribe to make the gold available. Once the beginning of the month is favorable, they should give (the gold) to the craftsmen so that they can do their work.
To the king, my lord: your servant, Urdu-Nabû. Good health to the king, my lord. May Aššur, Sin, Šamaš, Marduk, Zarpanitu, Nabû, Tašmetu, Ištar of Nineveh, and Ištar of Arbela — these great gods who love your kingship — allow the king, my lord, to live 100 years.

I interrogated (him and) recovered half a mina of gold. When I recovered it, I wrote to the king, my lord. Now there is another thief. I arrested him on the 21st. I myself and Ṭab-šar-Sin interrogated him and recovered the gold.
Perhaps they will say to the king, my lord: " He is a staff-bearer." (But) Nabû-ahhe-šallim captured temple thieves before me. This is the second time. Let Nabû-ahhe-šallim come and ask questions. But the city must not be wrecked on account of repressive measures. The king, my lord, should appoint a city overseer.

The chief victualler arrested and interrogated me without (the authorization of) the king or the crown prince. He plundered my patrimony. All that my father had acquired under the king's aegis he plundered and carried off. At the same time, he took away one talent of refined silver and 20 minas of silver in the form of household utensils — gifts of the king and queen mother. I received/inherited my father's office, (but now) I am (even) chased away from the temple.
Let the crown prince take care of (this) lest I die without (the help of) the king or the crown prince.

Urdu-Nabû, the priest, has written a field, a house and people, sons of temple votaries, in a sealed document and has thus made them his own. Therefore, I am left with no control over them. I have now written to the king, my lord, that the king, my lord, may know (about it).

Furthermore, it is time to (begin) work on the foundations of the ziggurat. We will issue the order and they shall begin with it. Shebat (XI) is a favorable month. (Once) the king sends word, they will lay it.
Didî, the architect who was appointed for the work on Esaggil, is here. I told him: " Come with me to lay the foundations," but he said: " There is no way I can go without the king's order. I delivered a document to the palace concerning the magazine of Esaggil about which I came. But they have not yet issued an order to me." They should issue an order for him so that he can go with me.

Now then I and the mayor of Calah had the overseer of the city-gates go down to Urdu-Marduk and Sangu-Issar, and he had a look. The king, my lord, should ask him how much was cut off.
How many have they become now? They have been taught (a lesson), but (still) they don't keep their hands off the temple.

As of now, no one is bringing in the first fruits of your land or the one-fifth tax from Barhalzi.

As for the golden table of Marduk, which Sargon had made, he assigned a goldsmith to it. He removed the old work and replaced it with new.
Furthermore, the dragons upon which Nabû stands, and the socle between them — he has made a sketch out of them. One of the clergymen saw him, but he turned him back and let him go. No one has authority, and no one says (anything) to him.
He has appointed officials of his own choosing in the temple. Moreover, the king's father set up golden bottles of ...-liter capacity (with) royal images on them. They would fill with wine the one in front of Bel and the one in front of Nabû. They would be decanted. The wine was the palace allotment. Now this has been stopped.

One talent, 19 minas of gold are also in town, (namely) that of the agate in the treasury of Sin, along with all the votive gifts; and the 18 1/6 minas of gold and 21 minas of silver for the guard(ian) of the oxen to be sacrificed before the king are likewise deposited in the treasury of the temple of Sin.
Two big royal images, 50 images of cherubs and winds, of silver, 3 silver doorjambs, 1 silver kettle. All this work is done. Their weight is each 5 talents of silver less 12 minas.
What the king, my lord, made for the walls of the shrine of Nikkal is stored in the treasury of Nikkal.
Furthermore, there is one mina of silver by the heavy standard (= 60 kg) with a scroll (bearing) the seal of Sin-na'di, chief goldsmith, attached to it, who says: " It is from my work allotment." But he has no work allotment yet at his disposal. What is it that the king, my lord, commands?
This silver, about which I am writing to the king, my lord, is from revenues, and has been neither refined nor cleaned.
And concerning the pole of the divine emblem about which the king, my lord, spoke, saying: " I have heard that it collapsed of its own accord" — it is (in fact) in excellent condition, O king, my lord. There is no break, no burn-hole, and no blister on it.
When they made the burn-hole, they made it too quickly, so that the lower stem did not slip through.

Now they (and) Gugal-namruti stand at your gate, and Bel-matati stands with them. The outrider has come with a message concerning the prayer bowl. Give it to him. Let him go to Ešarra that I may take possession of it, and that I may send Gugal-namruti to the lands.

The ..., a servant of Nabû-šallim-ahhe, said the following: " When the king transferred me from Nineveh to Calah, and when the deportees petitioned for barley rations and the cupbearer returned from Calah for the rations, I sealed his (load of) produce on the second day out from the Succession Palace and brought out the golden Warrior Erra from inside it."
And the temple stewardess says: " When Nabû-zer-ketti-lešir returned from the Inner City, he entered the presence of Nabû-šallim-ahhe. Nabû-šallim-ahhe questioned him over and over, saying: ' From where have you come?' He replied: ' I came from the Inner City.' (Whereupon Nabû-šallim-ahhe) said: ' You! You! — Why do you want to die as a liar?! Produce the ... goods in your possession and bring them to me!' Then Nabû-abu-da''in, the cook, cried out. He picked up Warrior Erra and gave it to him along with one set of clothing. That evening and the following morning, he produced 2 ...-containers. This cook, Nabû-abu-da''in, was beaten on the fifth day and died from the beatings."

If he in fact did not attack me and they are not handing (me) over, then he should say so before the king! The threat to my person about which I testified against them in the king's presence is the fact that they daily take an oath against me, saying: " Let's kill him!" But because they couldn't kill me they are speaking to the king's magnates, their allies, and they are filing complaints against me before the king.
It was only when they said to me " Swear to us" about an earlier letter which I in fact had not sent to the king, that I sent my letter to the palace. I said nothing to them, but they still beat me! The king has seen this face of mine which they beat, but not one report or one oath against them enters the palace. They've turned the whole palace against me!
May Marduk and Zarpanitu bless the king of the universe, my lord! The king must not deliver me into their hands! I am alone. I have no one. They beat me, and with each blow ... I die. I have no one.

This 5th day of Kanun (X) belongs to Talmusu. No oxen, no rams — nothing whatever has been brought. For the sake of the life of the king, my lord, his name, and his progeny, I have carried out the sacrifices before Aššur and the gods of the king, my lord. I have prepared the entire meal to perfection and brought it into the presence of Aššur.
To the king, my lord: your servant, Aššur-hamatu'a. Good health to the king, my lord. May Aššur, Ištar, Bel, and Nabû bless the king, my lord.
Nabû-epuš, the priest of Ea, has stolen property from the temple. He peeled off and removed the golden ... from the massive (offering) table which is in front of Ištar. Nabû-nadin-apli, the temple guard, caught him red-handed.
Even before my time, the priest of Ea committed a theft, but they (the temple authorities) retrieved it and covered it up.
The king should question him about both (cases).
When the king, my lord, had not yet stationed me in my post, they used to commit thefts and cover them up. (Left) on their own, they (can) cover (everything) up without any effort, (thus) causing great whispering in the temple.
Now they are all of one accord, saying: " Let's do it this way." I speak to them, but they don't listen. (What) I have heard I have written to the king, my lord. The king, my lord, should do as he deems best.
(One other note): Nabû-epuš, who committed the robberies, is a lamentation priest. He is not to ascend the dais.

I was coming to the king, my lord, (but) when Mar-Issar came saying: " I will inscribe the pedestals" — as far as he was concerned there was nothing worth looking at. (So) I was delayed in his presence. As soon as he has finished with me here, I will come and kiss the feet of the king, my lord.
The statues of the king which Mar-Issar brought here, saying: " Inspect (them), and let the one which is perfect stand" — when the scholars and I, (all) servants of the king, inspected (them) together, the very statue which I sent to the king, my lord, was perfect in that the king, my lord, is girding himself, and you(!) are entering before Marduk, your god; (this) is the very statue which I sent to the king, my lord. The arrangement of the clothing of the king, my lord, is just like that (of the statues) which they are setting up in Assur upon the dais of Bel (and) I have set up in Esaggil and the temples of Babylon. Let the king have a look; and if it pleases the king, my lord, let one exactly like his stand, or if it does not please the king, my lord, let the very statue of the king, my lord, which I sent, stand.
When Aha-iddina, the chief votary, Balaṭu, the ' farmer' of Bel, Bel-ušallim, and Nabû-eriba — grooms of the royal delegate — invoked the right of appeal to the king, I sent them to the king. Let the king hear what they have to say. But they are telling me the following: " When the two eunuchs ran away from Assyria, the royal delegate hid them in his house. And now he has sent them to Borsippa." I can not act on my own authority and bring them from Borsippa. If it pleases the king, my lord, let the king's messenger come with them and lead them here (from) where they are living before they hear and go somewhere else.
I have captured the eunuch about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me. I am now occupied with Mar-Issar. As soon as we have completed our work, I will bring him (the eunuch) with me.
Whoever has a brother or someone inside the palace can rely on him. I, however, have no one in the palace of the king, my lord, except the king, my lord. I pray to Marduk and Šeru'a for the sake of the life of the king, my lord.
Imbâ, of the Gallabu family, the ' measurer' of the governor, has come from Elam. The governor hasn't seen him. You, O king, should know (this).
To the king, lord of kings, my lord: your servant, Aplaya, the priest of Kurba'il. Good health to the king, my lord. May Adad, Šala, and Šarrat-nakkanti — the gods who dwell in Edurhenunna — bless the king, my lord, and keep him alive. May they give the king, my lord, happiness and physical well-being. May they grant long days and everlasting years to the king, my lord.
... I did not write/send.
... the weavers have not given the clothing. Perhaps the king, my lord, will say: " From where did they issue them in the past?" They used to issue the work-quotas from the palace, and the weavers from Arbela used to weave them.

Concerning what my lord wrote to me: "..., if I am in Meturna" — until my messenger came from my lord's presence, did he say that the governor is in Meturna?

the ... are in his charge, and the horse s are in charge of the prefects of the recruitment officers and of the scribe.
Let the king, my lord, make it crystal-clear to them that they must bring the men and horses to me. Not one recruitment officer should be late. Let them quickly bring the men and horses to me.

Concerning Nabû-šumu-iddina and Nabû-eriba, the physicians about whom I spoke to the king, my lord, now then I am sending them care of my messenger to the king my lord's presence. Let them enter the king my lord's presence, and let the king my lord speak with them. Truly, I have not disclosed nor told them where the king, my lord, is sending them.
Šamaš-belu-uṣur wrote to me from Der: " Should we really not put any inscriptions in the walls of the temple?" I am now writing to the king, my lord: let one inscription be written and sent to me (as a model), and let them write the rest according to it and put them in the walls of the temple.
It has rained abundantly and the crops are fine. The king, my lord, can be glad.
To the king, my lord: your servant Issar-duri. Good health to the king, my lord!
Nabû-zeru-ibni, the Ru'uean eunuch whom the king, my lord, returned from Damascus from the service of Bel-duri and sent to Abdudu to Bel-... in the hope that the Ru'uean and his people would come to him —
(when) Merodach-Baladan heard of his having come, he had all his brothers brought (before him), and spoke with them as follows: " Now that his brother has come, you will run away to him!" They said to him, " Why should we run away? (This) brother of ours who has come is on the other side. He came, but he will go back again."
They are not assembled and have not yet sent their messenger and intentions to him, (thinking), " (If) we sent it and the king (then) defeated Merodach-Baladan, and (if) these words reached the king's ears ...
the words ......

I also told Nabû-zeru-ibni: " Now then go gather your people, and take them to the Palace! As long as Bel-duri is in the Palace, go appeal to him ...!"
So now then I am sending the Ru'uean and his letter with my messenger to the presence of the king my lord. His staying here in my presence is totally unproductive. He and Nabû-šallim ... are (just) playing would-be-kings.

I met a messenger from Parsua (who told me): " The Zalipaeans have come forth; they have come forth with 100 horses in their hands. Four men from among them ran away to the desert and came to Nikkur, (where) they said: ' We have brought horses from our country, but the Mannean has detained (them) inside his country.'"
I am now writing to the king, my lord: Let the king, my lord, send a bodyguard to listen to what the Zalipaeans have to say. Perhaps they will bring the horses out.
I shall supply the deficit of the king, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-belu-ka''in. Good health to the king, my lord!
Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Why have you appropriated towns and fields of Il-yada' in the province of Arrapha and in Šamaš-naṣir?" — what towns of his have I taken in the province of Arrapha?
As to Šamaš-naṣir, did I not appeal to the king, my lord, that it be given to him? The king, my lord, (however) gave Šamaš-naṣir to me, saying: " Give (him) a town in its stead." The town I gave him lies right ahead of his city. Is Šamaš-naṣir (as much) at my disposal? And he is appropriating its villages!
If the king, my lord, commands, I will choose a town, and he can go and enter it, (and) return this town.
... Let me and him ... and plead our cases in the presence of the king, my lord, and let the king decide between us.
For 15 days in Tishri (VII) I was in the presence of the king my lord, and he was there too. He should have appealed while I was there, and we should have spoken with each other. Why did he appeal to the king only when I had come here?
Now the king, my lord, should write to Il-yada' that he come to the review. I shall come too and bring my witnesses with me. Nashur-Bel should come and arbitrate between us. Let us litigate with each other, and let the king decide between us.
As to Sumaya about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me: " A servant of Il-yada' from Mandiru has gone with him, let him gather his brothers and (then) go away" —

I shall send ...... of the king of Elam.
Now then I am sending to the king, my lord, the letter of Naṣibi that came to Nabû-iqiša.
I went as far as Meturna with Il-yada', passed those people through, returned, and met Balaṭî on the 9th day in Dur-Bel-ila'i. Now then I am going where the king, my lord, sent me to. I have sent (word), and my king's men are on the alert.
Let them quickly send me a copy of this letter of Naṣibi so I can send it to Nabû-iqiša.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-belu-ka''in. Good health to the king, my lord!
The scholar who is in my service — the treasurer wrote that ...

To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šarru-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! The land of the king my lord is well.
Concerning the news of the district, they told me previously: " Ašpa-bari has told Kibabiše and Dasukku: ' The king gave Ellipi to me and I shall enjoy it. He gave Šingibutu to Marduk-šarru-uṣur. It is your towns that have been snatched away. If you (want to) fight, do so, or leave it; I am not involved in it.'" He spoke thus before the people of the country.
Now Kibabiše and Dasukku are constantly running about opposite me with a hundred cavalrymen. The king, my lord, knows that their own cavalrymen are (only) twenty (in number); x of them are Lutû's, and the rest of the cavalrymen are Ašpa-bari's. They do not openly show that they are running around with them.
Concerning the barley rations about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, I have put aside 1,000 homers of barley and deposited it in the town Saba.... And now I am taking out more of the harvest.
As to the news of the magnates, I asked the Mede who brings their letters where they are, and he told me that they went on the 3rd of Tishri (VII) to the land of Yadburu.
To the king, my lord: your servant Aššur-belu-taqqin. Good health to the king, my lord!
Concerning the people of Hazannu about whom the king, my lord, wrote me, I have now gathered them all, written them down by name, and am herewith sending them to the king, my lord:
Ubaru, his brother Nabû-bani, one suckling son, two women, total 5;
Palihka-libluṭ;
Nabû-aha-ereš, his brother, one son of 4 spans, two women, total 5;
Zazaya, one son of 4 spans, one woman, two daughters, total 5;

Amat-Bel-uṣur, one son of 5 spans, three women, total 5;
Na'id-bit-Šeriga, his brother Nabû-nadin-ahi, three women, total 5;

Iqišaya and Rihani, fowlers, one son of 3 spans, two women, total 5;
the woman Paltaṣi and her sister, total 2 daughters of Hazannu.
In all 12 able-bodied men, one son of 5 spans, two sons of 4 spans, one son of three spans, one suckling son, 15 women, two daughters, all told 35 men and dependents. Five out of them are missing; three have been sold for money to Babylon. What has been given to the house of Il-yada' we don't know.
However, there is definitely only one servant of his among all these people. As for the rest, the king, my lord, may ascertain by inquiring that they are not servants of his.
I got afraid of punishment when the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Should you lose even one of them, know that you shall bear the blame on account of (all of) them," so I am bringing out and giving away all of them.
Sapiku, Aqaba, La-baši, Zaqiru, and Bel-le'i, a total of five men from Darati, have spoken thus:
" We bear the responsibility for Darati. We shall bring Sa'eru and whatever men are loyal to him into the city by means of tunnels, capture Darati and give it to Marduk-šarru-uṣur. Let them work on the houses. At a house which lends itself to the work we will cut a tunnel inside, and we shall bring in the men through it. They should work on (the houses of) Eriba and Sîn-duru-uṣur.
" After one of them has by studied words entered Darati, we shall bring the men in through the tunnels and capture the city. As to one of them who lends himself to the work, he should go and enter Darati. Let Marduk-šarru-uṣur come at late night and surround the wing of Atâ."
He says there are no men who are not loyal to Sa'eru in Sapiku's house. He says Merodach-Baladan will not come to their help.
" I have repeatedly gone to Merodach-Baladan, saying: ' Let your horses come, and let them be a fort for us.' He has not agreed, but said: ' If it is your heart('s desire), oblige!'"
To the king, my lord: your servant Nergal-eṭir. The best of health to the king, my lord! The land of the king is well. The king, my lord, can be glad indeed.

Concerning the audience gift of the month Kanun (X) about which the king, my lord, wrote: " You are to bring me two horses, two bulls, 20 sheep, and 20 jugs (of wine)" — the letter arrived only on the 3rd of Shebat (XI); when can they possibly (deliver it)? Moreover, the king knows that the bulls of this country are very small. Would I not know (the size of) the bulls (given as) audience gift to the house of my lords?
Ever since the king, my lord,

The royal offerings, 40 bulls and sheep for the rites in Babylon, which the king had imposed upon us — last year we gave them in Nisan (I), but the king, my lord, said: " Give them in Tishri (VII)."
Now then the bulls and the sheep are available, but they have not been brought because of the cold and the (swollen) rivers. As the king himself said, let us deliver them in Tishri (VII). But, should we bring them down now, they will (have to) slaughter the sheep. What is it that the king, my lord, commands?
As soon as the king comes to Babylon, I shall come with one chariot to pay my respects to the king.
To the king, my lord: your servant Aššur-belu-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord!
Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Set out with your troops and tribute, and come" — I shall do my best to set out with the troops and tribute, but because of the snow I had to leave one chariot that came with me in Bit-Hamban. The king knows that there is very much snow.

I sent the letter to the Palace on the 25th of Tishri (VII).
To the king, my lord: your servant Šarru-emuranni. Good health to the king, my lord! The fort is well.
Perhaps the king, my lord, will say: " What is the news of the son of Zerî?" Previously they told me that he has gone to the Puqudu. Now the second time they have told me that he is in Uruk. My messenger has gone to Sapia; after he has come back, I shall send a full report to the king, my lord, whatever news there is. The king, my lord, can be very glad.

Now, the king, my lord, has (already) three or four times written to me in this manner; how can I live? My heart does not beat, blood has dried up in my veins.
I do my work like my equals. I am not the first among them, nor am I the worst; I do as they do. Why does the king, my lord, single me out as if I did not obey the king, my lord?
Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Be in Meturna and keep watch!" — right now I am in Dur-Anuniti, between Meturna and Dur-Bel-ila'i, in the piedmont. My troops are with me, but the son of Yakin is in Babylon.

As to the weir about which the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Be attentive! Why is the work assignment behind schedule?" — they have not finished digging the rivers which they undertook, it being the time of cultivating the seeds, but have moulded bricks and trodden (earth).
I released the men, so they have dug their rivers and moulded bricks. (Now) they have gone down at it again in their full power and are finishing up clearing off the work assignment which they did not finish.
Its bridge has been completely built. After the river has been completely cleared out, then I shall send (word) to Aššur-belu-taqqin: " Come, let us open the weir!"

From the men at my disposal, 135 had died.
When the caravan of Kar-Šarrukin arrived, I sent (word), had them (= the Tabaleans) brought to me, had them occupy the houses of the deceased, and gave them oxen, sheep and women. The king's bodyguard took advantage of their oxen, sheep and women, (but) did they run away for lack of things? If they really had run away for lack of things, they should have come to me. Why did they go to Mannea?
By the gods of the king, my lord: I did not know that the Tabaleans had run away. I heard about it (only) when I came out of Media. I sent (word) to Mannea, Mazamua and (Bit-)Hamban, and they did bring some men from among them from Mannea.
Now the king wrote to me, and I have provisioned the captives.
The king, my lord, knows if I am negligent or a do-nothing. Let the king, my lord, have a look at the ... of Nikkur, Ti zu, Kiguhtu and Kizahasi, (all) fortresses situated on the enemy border and abandoned: If I have revived one of them, is it a crime? The king will punish me accordingly.

Furthermore, they went in and captured the servant of the king, my lord, and destroyed all the vines and ... that were there. Even the town of Am-yata' was similarly ravaged.

Nabû-iqiša sent me the following report on Elam: " Two messengers of the son of Yakin went to meet the king's brother-in-law, saying: ' Go to the city of HAR.' The king's brother-in-law did not agree to return but said: ' I have reached the border, how can I return unopposed from a used-up territory without the king's permission?'
" He (then) sent one of his two messengers to the king of Elam, the other one ......
" The king's brother-in-law wrote to ...: ' Bring us the ... s, so we shall give you your men.'"
This report is not how the source of the scribe of the palace has it. If the king my lord (so) commands, he should send another one.
It rained heavily on the 18th day. It (also) rained on the 23rd day.
I said: " Speak kindly with them, furnish them with ..., and give back all the horses that you took!"
They did not agree but said: " We will not give them .... When the horses and mules ..., and he has come, then we shall pass them over." And they said: " Bring the men who went to Nabû-belu-ka''in, and we will ...!"

As to the news of Daltâ, he is not leaving (his) house and nobody is entering into his presence. I have heard that he is collecting the rest of the tribute. I shall obligate him to deliver it.
I have taken the released Medes who are in my presence (and) 30 horses. The remaining people are with me.
I have received the tribute of the land of Zakrutu, 40 horses. They promised to give the rest of the tribute.

You took over the property of my father's house ...: the woman Ilussa and her two sons, the woman Muhhi-ili-šapkaku and her daughter, a total of 5 persons; a bed including a wooden board, 3 blankets, a bedspread, chairs, (and) a table.
My father ordered: " Her daughter is to be adopted." She has given (her) in accordance with her preference one silver bracelet (and) one silver daššu-implement. In all, 32 shekels of silver on the golden weight.
It is a deed that is adverse to my lord. I myself have no bread to eat; my lord knows that. May my lord do what he sees fit.

Let the king ask the cohort commanders: " Where are the men?" The men have gone away and entered the palaces because of the ilku-duty.

Concerning the house of Aššur-naṣir and the house of the chief scribe about which the king, my lord, ordered me: " Inspect them!"
The house of the chief scribe is a tiny house. Even a donkey would not enter there. (Whereas) the house of Aššur-naṣir, a nobleman, is good (but) much repair (must be done) there.
The eunuch who was sent (to) the house of Aššur-naṣir has collected all the equipment there and piled them up in my storehouses and in my bedroom.

They are systematically scaring me. There is no friend of mine here. I put my trust in the king, my lord. I do not give one shekel (or even) half a shekel to anybody but the king, my lord.
May the king, my lord, not leave me in their hands. I am (but) a dead dog. May I wield the brooms in the palace of the king, my lord! May I decorate the interior of the palace of the king, my lord! May the gods of heaven and earth bless the king, my lord!
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-rehtu-uṣur. May Bel and Belet, Nabû and Tašmetu, Ištar of Nineveh and Ištar of Arbela, your gods (who) called you by name to kingship, keep you alive!
Those who sin against your father's goodness, your father's and your own treaty, and who plot against your life, shall be placed in your hands, and you shall delete their name from Assyria and from your palace.

Concerning the ... in Adia, they have finished ..., (but) for laying the foundations, the earlier foundation stone which we loosened was (too) calcareous.
Now, there is another foundation stone at hand. If the king so orders, let the name of the king be written on that and we shall build it in. Alternatively, the king may command: " Build in the old one!" May the king write to his servant what the king finds acceptable.
As to the wood which we are to trample between the foundation stone, let the king command whence it will be given. Let the king order the chief scribe to write the name of the king on the stele, and at the same time to look up a favourable day for the (objects) to be placed in the doorjambs of the house.

Concerning the six men (and) one woman about whom I wrote to the king, my lord — Kutî the scribe, Tutî the scribe, Adad-killanni the priest, Qurdî the chariot driver, Niri-Ia'u the chief of accounts, Palṭi-Ia'u the deputy, (and) Zazâ, the wife of Tarṣî, (all) servants of the governor — as to the matter of Guzana, they know if there is (such a thing), and if there isn't, they know it, too.
The king, my lord, should speak with them, but (first) let me tell the king, my lord, about their other crimes.
The first crime of Kutî and Tutî: When my son commanded them, " Bring me the horses, so that I can bring (them) to the king!," they refused.
Their other crime: (In the reign of) the father of the king, my lord, they wrote the silver quota of the shepherds on an Assyrian document (and) on an Aramaic document and sealed the amount of silver with the neck seals of the treasurer Nabû-qati-ṣabat, the village manager, (and) the scribe, with their neck seals (and) with the (royal) stamp seal, saying: " If they don't pay this year, they will die!" (But) when a bribe was made, they cut off the stamp seals (and) their neck-seals, (and) threw them away. Did they not cut (them) off arbitrarily?
Qurdî, the chariot driver of the treasury horses, is treading on (the authority of) the Palace. He has laid his hands on the cone of Ištar, saying: " Strike (f. sg.) me! Let's see (what happens)! Bring me an iron knife, (so) I can cut it off and stick it in the governor's ass!" I am unable to tell what else he has said about everybody.
The priest (Adad-killanni) has encouraged him; I am powerless.
Šamaš-emuranni, the governor, took counsel with Palṭi-Ia'u (the deputy) and Niri-Ia'u (the chief of accounts), saying: " Who(se feet) should we grasp?" They told the governor: " The one who dressed you in purple garments (and) gave you the golden bracelet (and) the golden dagger ......." The governor said: " Go out and gather the elders of the city of Guzana in front of the crown prince's palace! ... no bracelets, no ...."
I am being told that he asked them (= the elders): " To whom are you devoted?" Adda-sakâ, a chariot owner, answered: " Tell us, why do you ask us? Ask our sons!" He said: " It is you I have asked, so tell me!" They answered of one accord: " We have eaten the slice of our sons and daughters, and that of Aššur-zeru-ibni too, but we keep the treaty of the king, we are devoted to Esarhaddon."
The governor threw the sceptre from his hands, placed his arms on his chest, and said: " You are his servants! What are you saying? You ... your dynastic house! I ...... your city."
Halbišu the Samarian, a servant of the king, my lord, (and) Bar-uri, the eunuch (and) maqaltānu-official of Ba'al-rakkab of Sam'al, told me this matter:
Tarṣî, the scribe of Guzana, has given his son to the household of Aššur-zeru-ibni. When Aššur-zeru-ibni is with the sons of the king, the son of Tarṣî is the chief of accounts. During these ten days when Aššur-zeru-ibni is lingering in Nineveh, the son of Tarṣî is the chief tailor, taking care of the golden bracelet, the golden dagger and the parasol of Aššur-zeru-ibni.
This Tarṣî, O king, my lord, is a powerful (and) influential man. He has taken away the servants of the queen, of the crown prince, of the household of the magnates (and) the exempts, (and) given them to the household of Aššur-zeru-ibni.
Moreover, the messengers whom the king, my lord, sends to Guzana — who hears (all) the slighting remarks that Tarṣî and his wife make (about them)? Zazâ, the wife of Tarṣî, and her sons should not be kept alive. O king, my lord! The priest is a brother-in-law of Tarṣî. Their wives bring down the moon from the sky!
O king, my lord, concerning (this), in all the letters which I have sent to the king, my lord, there is just this one matter. I have been shamed. On account of the words that I have spoken ..., instead of Aššur-zeru-ibni ..., I have butted Marduk-išmanni ....
The king, my lord, is the sun! I am a servant of the king, my lord, (but) I do not see ....
And the words spoken by Milki-nuri, O king, my lord, are not accurate. I will tell the king, my lord, the very first day when I enter before the king. His words are within my ears. Let me see the face of the king, my lord, .... Should the king, my lord, say: " Why did you not write what you heard?" — ....
To (the lady) Balti-lešir, my lord: your (f.) servant Nabû-ahu-iddina.

...... they have gone up
Concerning the men who appeal for royal intervention, the king, my lord, should not tarry. Let the men come and speak up, and may the king familiarise himself with their cases. May the king seize upon the matter which is acceptable to him. What is not acceptable to the king, my lord, the king, my lord, may drop.
If one is a servant of the king and tells about his prefect or about his governor, his prefect should be given clear instructions about him; (and) if one is a servant of an Assyrian, his lord should be told in no uncertain terms: " He rests in the king's protection — nobody may litigate against him! You must not lead him to ..., he must not be detained!"
(Should) the king, my lord, finish off his men, one might go to his comrade and say: " I too want to speak before the king." No, O king, my lord!

To the king, my lord: your servant Bel-iqiša. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord.
Last year in Tarninu the king, my lord, gave to his servant two teams of horses from the possession of ... the eunuchs of the treasurer. They used to eat ... at the expense of the treasurer.
I have tried to speak with Nabû-..., the scribe of the major domo, saying, " Give the previous (amount of) fodder to the horses," but he has slighted me and is telling me: " I will cut you off from the inner quarters!"
Ever since the king, my lord, appointed me in my lord's household, I have no authority over anybody in my lord's household.
I have also spoken with my own scribe, but (the other) one is plotting to kill me. He has wrapped up the whole house of my lord and subjected it to himself, and has been distributing gifts to have me killed. In the same way he has given out gifts and pulled out the scribe in my service.
The king, my lord, should know (this).
To the king, my lord: your servant Bel-iqiša. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord.
The servants of my lord's household who(se status) the king, my lord, has determined (as of) today:
Tabalayu son of Bel-Harran-ahu-uṣur, whom the king, my lord, promoted to the rank of cohort commander; Nabû-sagib, whom the king, my lord, promoted to the rank of permanent ' third man'; (and) Atamar-Marduk, whom the king, my lord, promoted to the rank of bodyguard —
these three men are drunkards. When they are drunk, none of them can turn his iron sword away from his colleague.
I have written to the king, my lord, (about) a matter that I know. The king, my lord, may do as he deems best.
To the king, our lord: your servants PN, Bel-iqiša and Babilayu. Good health to the king, our lord! May Aššur, Šamaš, Bel (and) Nabû give long days and everlasting years to the king, our lord.
The king, our lord, knows that the audience gift of Kanun (X) has been stocked up but there are no shelters where we could deposit the king's wine. May the king, our lord, command that (storage) rooms be shown to us, so that we may proceed.
There is much wine of the king — where should we put it?
To the king, my lord: your servants Nabû-ra'im-nišešu and Salamanu. Good health to the king, our lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, our lord.
As to the deserters whom the governor of Der sent to me (and) about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Interrogate them!" — we have interrogated them.
Bur-Silâ, ' third man' of the crown prince; Kudurru, servant of Mannaipite, likewise a ' third man' of the crown prince. Total two Elamites. Rama-il, a man from Arrapha, chariot fighter of the governor, Addiqritušu, (and) servants of Iairu, the Gambulean:
Fifteen deserters whom the governor of Der sent to me.
To the king, my lord: your servant Kinâ. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord.
The exempt(s) who were brought to me are at the moment staying outside Arbela.
Now the chief cook is telling me: " They have told me from the Palace: ' Order Kinâ to line up in my (= king's) presence (and) follow you.'"
Now what does the king, my lord, command?
To the king, my lord: your servant Ibašši-ilu, the ...
My brother has died on account of the lawsuit for which I appealed to your father, and my son is being slaughtered because of it.
The king is the bulwark of the weak one. Let the king ask: I am about to be killed, lost, roaming about.
I have found rest in the reign of the king. May the king save me!
To the king, my lord: your servant Ubru-Nabû. Good health to the king, my lord! May Bel, Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh (and) Ištar of the Kidmuru temple very greatly bless the king, my lord. May they give happiness (and) physical well-being to the king, my lord. The garrisons of the king, my lord, are well.
Šumma-ilu, the son of Aramiš-šar-ilani, the recruitment officer, has appealed in my presence for royal intervention, saying:
" My father died in enemy country. The fifty men who were under his command, took twelve horses in their hands and came (back); they are (now) staying in the surroundings of Nineveh. I said to them: ' My father may be dead, but why did you leave the royal guard and come (back)?'"
Now then I am sending him to the presence of the king, my lord. May the king, my lord, question him, and may he tell the king, my lord, how the matter is.
That merchant from Carchemish was killed by his servants, (but) not even one of them escaped, we have arrested (them all). I am sending to the king, my lord, the protection of Mullissu (and) of the Lady of Kidmuri, the mothers who love you.
With regard to Sippar, may the king, my lord, be vigilant, so we can relax.
Let me hear the health of the king, my lord, wherever what (= anything).
To the crown prince, my lord: your servant Ubru-Nabû. The best of health to the crown prince, my lord! May Bel, Nabû, Mullissu, the Lady of Kidmuri (and) Ištar of Arbela give happiness, physical well-being, (and) enjoyment of life to the crown prince, my lord.
I have brought the leftovers of Nabû to the crown prince, my lord. All the guards are well. The crown prince, my lord, can be very glad.
To the king, my lord: your servant Ubru-Nabû. Good health to the king, my lord! The king, my lord, can be glad!
As to the guard, which the king, my lord, appointed to me, it is doing very well.
To the crown prince, my lord: your servant Ubru-Nabû, the scribe of the new palace. Good health to the crown prince, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the crown prince, my lord.
From Aššur-šezibanni, the governor whom the crown prince ...
To the king, my lord: your servant Mannu-ki-Libbali. Good health to the king, my lord! May Bel (and) Nabû bless the king, my lord.
As to the matter of the ' third man' and the chariot driver of the palace scribe, about whom the king, my lord, wrote to his servant, saying: " Tell me the truth!" — how could I speak dishonestly to the king, my lord? What have I been able to give to my lord in exchange for this favour that the king, my lord, has shown his servant? Would the patronage of the palace scribe have had such an influence over me that I would still be obliged to him? (No), I shall tell to the king, my lord, the thing that I have seen and heard.
The king, my lord, knows from those times when I was (still) in his service how he used to regard me and what trust he used to place in me. (But) ever since the king, my lord, appointed me to his household, it has been intolerable to him. In fact, he told the king, my lord, not to appoint me. He regards me as a mortal enemy. He has gone ... (and) he has been spreading tales about me — the king, my lord, should ask the ... s and the servants of the palace scribe.
Hence, now that we have settled the Kushite girls in the royal palace — a matter about which I wrote several times to the king, my lord — Kanunayu, the deputy, has made me out to be even more hateful to him, and he (now) regards me as very much of a mortal enemy indeed.
It is in this light that the king, my lord, should determine what the truth is.
I swear that I did not know (and) did not learn about this matter, that I am not implicated in it, that I have told the king, my lord, (the truth about) what I heard in the inner precinct of Calah, what the wife of the ' third man' speaks against me, and (why) I refused to litigate with her, saying, " Let the king determine my veracity."
Bel and Nabû have given vast insight to the king, my lord. If I am implicated in this matter, let the king, my lord, punish me.
To the palace scribe, my lord: your maid Sarai. May Bel, Beltia, the Lady of Babylon, Nabû, Tašmetu, Ištar of Nineveh (and) Ištar of Arbela bless my lord! May they give long days, happiness and physical well-being to my lord.
There are seven persons, servants of my lord, whom the governor of Bet-nayalani took and gave to Marduk-eriba.
Now the(se) people are here. They have come to me, saying: " Speak in the presence of the palace scribe as long as Marduk-eriba does not allow us to enter."
The eunuch (whom) my lord ' sealed' is with them at the moment.
To the palace scribe, my lord: your servant Tabnî. The best of health to my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless my lord! Enter Nineveh in good spirits and see the face of Nabû (and) the face of the king in peace!
Now Abnî, the sheep-tax master of Arpad, is coming to the presence of my lord. He is a great friend of mine, and one who reveres my lord. My lord should trust him regarding the sheep. But give him clear instructions!
Why does my lord mistreat him? The man has not been properly treated. May my lord speak with the governor, and may the chief of accounts come (and) help him out.
The king's word to Ištar-...: I am well. You can be glad.
As to these men ... about whom you wrote: " Now ......"
The king's word to the mother of the king: I am well. Good health to the mother of the king!
Concerning the servant of Amos, about whom you wrote to me — just as the king's mother commanded, in the same way I have commanded. It is fine indeed, as you said.
Why does Hamunayu go?
Word of the king's daughter to Libbali-šarrat.
Why don't you write your tablet and do your homework? (For) if you don't, they will say: " Is this the sister of Šeru'a-eṭirat, the eldest daughter of the Succession Palace of Aššur-etel-ilani-mukinni, the great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria?"
Yet you are (only) a daughter-in-law — the lady of the house of Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria!
To the king of justice, my lord: your servant Bel-naṣir. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord.
When the king, my lord, was seated on the šaddattunu in Arbela, the king angrily told his servant: " Arrive before my arms!"
Weeping, I didn't arrive; I explained and told the king, my lord, that it was right (to do so). And in the presence of the king's servant, they said: "...."
That the king ... to my ...
They told it to me, (and) the king, my lord, questioned them.
I said to the king, my lord: " Nurî made noise like a swarm of locusts (and) did an evil thing. And he set us a ...."
A second time I said to the king, my lord: " May the king, my lord, have mercy on his servants, all those who used to arrive in his presence!"
On the xth day we will arrive in the king's presence with good intentions. May we not arrive because of ...!
To the king, my lord: your servant Šamaš-metu-uballiṭ. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord, very greatly.
Now, Babu-gamilat, a female servant of the king, is seriously ill. She does not (even) eat bread. Now, may the king, my lord, give orders that a physician come and see her.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šarru-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord.
A servant who is in trouble petitions his masters. I am (now) in trouble and petitioning the king, my lord. Let the king, my lord, appoint me, and let my accounts be made with the scribes. The scribes have wrenched me away from the king.
Now, ever since the king, my lord, appointed me, I have been revering the palace together with my household. I did not become a do-nothing before the king, my lord.
The king, my lord, knows that now ... not ....
May the king, my lord, act as he deems best.
31 talents of twine of linen; 80 talents of red wool, of the country; 07 talents of black (wool), of the country, 30 talents of alum, 10 talents of natron. In all, 158 talents.
Let the king, my lord, ask (about the matter): nobody gave me a mina (or even) half a mina from it.
To the king, my lord: your servant Bel-iqiša. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk very greatly bless the king, my lord.
Concerning the palace of the queen in Kilizi which the king, my lord, entrusted to me, I have demolished the house, the space for the foundations is open, and bricks have been stocked up for laying the foundations.
If the king, my lord, commands, the chief of the master builders may be ordered to come and lay the foundations.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-šarru-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to his servant: " Ask Balasî about the robes and write me from where they will be delivered!" — I have asked Balasî (and he answered): " We will supply red wool from the palace and they will do as ordered." Moreover, I have asked Aplaya (and he said): " They will give us red wool. The weavers of Ištar of Arbela will come (and) make (fabrics) in Kurbail."
Furthermore, we shall ... the multi-coloured textiles (placed) before the breast of Adad.
They have stopped the ... of the king.
To the king, our lord: your servants Ṣallaya, major domo, (and) Asalluhi-ereš, scribe. Good health to the king, our lord! May Nabû (and) Marduk bless the king, our lord.
The governors have squandered the household of our lord, (and) the king does not know. The governor of Arrapha has taken away the gift which the king gave to our lord. May it be known to the king, our lord, that the household of our lord has been squandered.
The king knows that our lord does not argue with his adversary; and when we litigate, they mistreat us. May the king entrust us to someone of his entourage, who will tell our story before the king. Moreover, may he appoint a royal bodyguard over the house of his servant, so that he may settle the lawsuits concerning the house.
The king's word to Issar-na'di: I am well. You can be glad.
As to Aššur-abu-iddina, whom you wrote to me about,
... which is not good
... has said ...
send me ...! But it is good that you wrote to me.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-ra'im-nišešu. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû (and) Marduk bless the king.
(As to) the objects of Umban-kidinni, which Riši-ilu the ' third man' brought down on a boat, they have checked them according to the writing-board and received them in the city of Sudanina. All is well. Nothing is missing.
To the king, my lord: your servant Aššur-ušallim. Good health to the king, my lord! May Aššur, Šamaš, Bel, Nabû, Nergal, Laṣ, Išum, Adad and Ber, (and) the great gods of heaven and earth bless the king, my lord, the crown prince of Assyria and the crown prince of Babylon a thousand times very greatly.
As to the garrisons appointed to the fortresses of Urarṭu, Mannea, Media (and) Hubuškia, about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me:
" Give them orders and make it very clear to them that they must not be negligent in their guard duty. Moreover, let them pay attention to the deserters from their surroundings. Should a deserter from Mannea, Media or Hubuškia fall in their hands, you are to put him immediately in the hands of your messenger and send him to the crown prince. And if he has something to say, you will tell it to the crown prince accurately. Make your report good!
" Let one ... scribe ... who guards ... s write it down from his dictation, let it be sealed with the cross-shaped (stamp) seal, and let Ahu-dur-enši, the cohort commander of the crown prince, quickly bring it to me by express delivery."
Now then two deserters from the land of the Manneans have arrived: one eunuch and one informer. I have sent them to the crown prince. They have things to say.
To the king, our lord: (your) servants, the mayors and elders of the Inner City. Good health to the king, our lord! May the gods of Ešarra greatly bless the king, our lord.
Your father, your grandfather, (and) the father of your grandfather exempted the city of Assur. (And) you have established additional privileges for us.
Now the men of the house of the governor have appointed officials over the Inner City. They are exacting corn taxes (and) collecting straw taxes.
You are the true seed of Sennacherib. Aššur and Šamaš have blessed you, your son, your son's son, generation to generation. You exercise kingship over us. (Yet) in your reign, they are exacting our corn taxes (and) collecting our straw taxes!
As to the houses about which the king, our lord, wrote to us: " What is the matter (with these)?" — we have asked (about them).
The (legal) documents ...

Nabû-naṣir, the staff-bearer, has told me:
" Sîn-balassu-iqbi, son of Nikkal-iddina, has sent 1 mina of gold with a chariot driver to Sasî, the superintendent of the crown prince, saying, ' What is it that the king, my lord, commands?'"
The document of the reimbursements (to be) paid by the king, my lord, which Kanunayu took out — I gave it to him, but he has brought it in again.
May it be brought out and given to me, so that I can pay the reimbursement according to it.
The king received the wife of the governor and brought her into the Palace. On the day we heard that the king was dead and the people of the Inner City were weeping, the governor brought his wife out of the palace. She burnt a female goat-kid, (while) he installed a eunuch of his as the mayor. His (other) eunuchs stand in the presence of the mayor, dressed in festive robes and wearing golden rings, while the singer, Qisaya, and his daughters keep singing (hymns) before them.
Regarding what we said, he (told us): "...."

The governor and the people of the Inner City ....

We went straight to Dannaya. He opened the gate and let Dannaya go out.
(As) we left for the (king's) corpse to weep (over it), we saw the governor with his troops dressed in armour and wearing iron swords. We got scared (and) said to the vizier and to Hambî: " Why are we weeping? The governor and his men are wearing iron swords and taking care of us."
He went straight to the Palace (and) to the Succession Palace, saying: " Open the door for me!" We will seize upon the governor.

My eyes are constantly fixed upon the king, my lord, and the crown prince, my lord, constantly encourages me.
As long as the crown prince is here and not going for the audience to Nineveh, how should I act? I have not set up a wail to the king, my lord, (but) the king, my lord, should have mercy on his people.

To the crown prince, my lord: your servant Šumaya. Good health to the crown prince, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the crown prince, my lord.
The king, your father, saw the work that I did in Tarbiṣu. I did it carefully, thinking: " May my name be good before my lord."
Now, the scribe whom my father appointed to count the work done by the drunks, and the nobles of my father who were assigned to the work — the moment they heard that a scribe had been appointed, they quit the work and ran away. The king, my lord, did not give me a house (nor) silver for the rest of the work.
Now, if it is acceptable to the crown prince, let them settle my accounts, let the crown prince hand over the work, and let me do the work in Calah assigned to my father and deliver it to the crown prince.
Nobody listens to me. (Should) it come to pass that I become a nobody before the crown prince, I will die. If only the crown prince, my lord, would turn his attention to me, I'd perform the works of the crown prince and deliver them to the crown prince, my lord. If I did not do it, who would do and deliver (them) to the crown prince? Would the accountant (and) the drunks do it?
May the crown prince, my lord, live forever, (and) may I revere the crown prince, my lord, with my arms and feet!
The crown prince, my lord, may enquire: Was my grandfather not assisted by the eunuch Aššur-belu-ka''in, (and) afterwards, when your grandfather ascended the throne, did he not appoint him to the position of a scribe? Now, may the crown prince, my lord, not forsake me! May the name of his grandfather and the position of my father not be lost from your house!
My father (and) my grandfather stayed in your house. The king, your father, loves the son of one who worked for him, feels concern for the son of one who worked for him. What is my fault? I am a dog of the crown prince, running about at the threshold of your house. May the crown prince, my lord, not forsake me!
I know (that) the crown prince, my lord,
... ... until ...
... ... the crown prince will ascend (the throne)

The crown prince, my lord, knows (that) once ... the master of the house is dead, the house (too) will perish after him. May the crown prince not forsake me!
To the king, my lord: your servant Mardî. May Ninurta, Zababa, Nergal, Madanu and Nabû bless the strong and righteous king, my lord.
From the beginning I have been his servant. My brother tried to make Bel-zeru-ibni kill me, (but) I grasped the feet of the crown prince, saved myself from it in darkness and hunger, and fled to the tower with the crown prince, my lord. Compassion took hold of the king; at my return, the crown prince sent a messenger with me, saying, " You are to give him back the things that the governor of Barhalza owes him."
I constantly prayed to Bel, Nabû and Šamaš for the king, my lord, saying, " May the crown prince, my lord, seize the royal throne of his father's house! I am his servant and his dog, who fears him; may I see light under his protection!"
Bel, Nabû and Šamaš heard (this) prayer for you, and they gave the king, my lord, an everlasting kingship (and) a long reign. And like sunshine, all the countries are illuminated by your light. But I have been left in darkness; no one brings me before the king. My outstanding debts, because of which I appealed to the crown prince, my lord, and (because of which) the king, my lord, sent (his messenger) with me, saying, " Give his outstanding debts back to him!" —
now Se'-rapa', the governor, refuses to give them (back), saying, " Appeal to the king!"
...... the Barhalzeans hate me
...... " Do you not give the field and orchards back to him!"
...... have been done without listening to ...

A tablet from Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, to Urtaku, king of Elam, my brother. I am well, your sons and daughters are well, my country and magnates are well. May Urtaku, king of Elam, my brother, be well, may my sons and daughters be well, may your magnates and your country be well!
Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bel, Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, Ištar of Arbela and Manziniri have now fulfilled and confirmed what they promised, (and) have developed our friendship to (its) peak.

From where the sun rises to where it sets, he (= Šamaš) has brought (all lands) to submission before the feet of the king, my lord.
The king, my lord, knows the nature of the land where the king, my lord, placed me. Ikkilû does not let the boats come up to the port of the king, my lord, but has turned the whole trade for himself. He provides for anyone who comes to him, but kills anyone who docks at the Assyrian harbour, and steals his boat. He claims: " They have written to me from the palace: ' Do only what is good for you!'".
There is a man called Ilu-ma'adi, from Ṣimirra. He goes back and forth to Assyria, finds out in detail whatever matter (and) news there is, and goes and tells it to him.
Perhaps the king, my lord, will say: " Why haven't you arrested him?" He is in his presence. I am afraid, I cannot seize him without the king, my lord's permission. The king, my lord, should know that there are many in the entourage of the king, my lord, who have invested silver in this house — they and the merchants are systematically scaring me. I (however) put my trust in the king, my lord. I don't give one shekel (or even) half a shekel to anybody but the king, my lord. The king, my lord, should know (this).
I am (but) a dead dog; the king, my lord, has revived me (from) a thousand pestilences. The king is my god and the king is my decor. Rescue me, do not let me die! May I know the brooms in the palace of the king! May I decorate the interior of the palace of the king, my lord! May the gods of heaven and earth bless the king, my lord!

There was an earthquake on the 21st of Elul (VI). The outer town in its entirety was damaged (lit. " scratched") but the whole wall of the outer city was saved; (only a stretch of) 30.5 cubits was torn out of it and fell into the centre of the city.

To the king, my lord: your servant Šamaš-šumu-ukin. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord.
Šaridu (and) Nabû-ahhe-ereš, citizens of Babylon, (and) Bel-iddina, a citizen of Borsippa, have sent me the (following) letter:
" The king concluded a treaty with us concerning you: ' Tell your lord whatever you hear!' Now, Bel-eṭir (and) Šamaš-zeru-iqiša have neglected the order the king gave them (and) are acting on their own. Aplaya, whom the king sent (with the command): ' Go (and) set up sanctuaries in Babylon!', has made common cause with them. They are observing the stars (and) dissecting lambs, but he does not report anything concerning the king, our lord, or the crown prince of Babylon. Aplaya alone is a haruspex; Bel-eṭir (and) Šamaš-zeru-iqiša are astrologers, they watch the sky day and night. Moreover, he has assembled the people who captured Aššur-nadin-šumi (and) delivered him to Elam, and has concluded a treaty with them, adjuring them by Jupiter (and) Sirius. We have now heard (about it) and informed the crown prince of Babylon."
Urdu-Nabû has written to Bel-eṭir and Šamaš-zeru-iqiša as follows:
" The treasurer who came, has come without (the consent of) the king. Scold him on my behalf! Sulaya, our brother, is kept in the Review Palace of Nineveh by royal command."

Whatever you have prayed to these gods for, may they very, very quickly bestow it upon you.
What else? The word of my lord is respected before his lords.
I am now writing to my lord, (as) from the first day on their little ones in Calah cannot go to school without funerary offering(s). May my lord keep his servants alive (with) the stored grain of Sivan (III), until a new barley ration falls to my share.
What else? I prayed to Nabû, and he appointed me to my lord's service. Nabû will intercede for me before my lord.

Your servant Nabû-zera-iddina: I would gladly die for the king, my lord! May Anu and Ištar bless the king! Say to the king, my lord:
When they heard from the citizens of Ur that ...
... Merodach-Baladan ...
they will perish ...
" Why did you give ... back to Merodach-Baladan?" The king, my lord, must not believe it! I have not given anything back to anyone.
Your servant Qišti-Marduk: I would gladly die for Sargon, the king of Babylon, the king of the lands, the mighty king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless Sargon, the king of Babylon, the king of the lands, the mighty king, my lord! Say to the king, my lord:
The sealed clay tablet which Sîn-duri, Nabû-šuma-iškun and their scribe wrote in Babylon and sent to the king, my lord, ... and the insolence therein ... — how can I hear anything through ... and stay alive!

saying, " Let me go to the king and ... speak to the king about it. You surely are aware of it ...." He backed off.
Nabû-šuma-iškun is saying to Sîn-duri: " Now I shall be installed in the prelateship." (But) nobody may install a prelate except you! Since the king, my lord, granted my prelateship, Sîn-duri is saying to Nabû-šuma-iškun: " You will see what Qištiya will do."
The servants of the king know very well that my prelateship, like (those of) all the prelates, is the king's affair. The king verily also grants the governor's office.
To the king, my lord: your servant Bel-iddina: I would gladly die for the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! Say to the king, my lord:
Concerning the writing-board of the temples, of which the king wrote to me: " Send the rest of the work and the remaining writing-boards here through Šarru-amuranni!" —
I have now examined (all the temples) from Nemed-Laguda to Šasanaku and have written the writing-boards. As the king commanded, I shall send them to the king, my lord, via Šarru-amuranni.
After I had examined the (temples) from Zabban to Sippar in the same way, I entrusted them to Nabû-ahhe-bulliṭ, the delegate of Esaggil. I shall certainly examine the rest of the temples in the vicinity of Babylon in the same way.
If the king wishes, let everything be written on one single writing-board. I am afraid to go to Der and Nippur without (explicit orders from) the king.
During my work, I listened closely, and in all Sealand there is no other servant of the king as devoted to the king and as loyal to the words of the king as Sîn-iddina. The whole of Bit-Yakin loaths him. Were Yakin still alive, one like Sîn-iddina would not be shielded.
The king should know all this!
Tablet of Sîn-duri to the king, his lord. The guard of Eanna and the temple of your gods are well.
Nabû-šuma-iškun, the governor, the foster child of the king, is paralysing me because of the garden and the men; he does not let me to do my work in peace. The king could solve the matter with one word, so that there would be silence between us! Now he is going to the audience of the king. Let the king decide what is (to be done).
Qištiya, the prelate, is turning me into a laughingstock in the assembly, he is telling me: " Chaff in excess of one litre should go for interest." With the king's prefect ... ..., and this ... me. I shall not speak before a word from the king.

Initially, when I did not come to the audience of the king, my lord, there were men who came from Elam to see the king, your father, and who, in order to obtain intercession for themselves, libelled me in the presence of the king. There was also a certain opponent of mine who said and wrote to the king bad things about me from Elam. When I heard of this, I did not come, because I was afraid. Now (however), I have become desirous of serving the king.
All those who initially committed a crime were forgiven by your royal father. (As to) all the libels that have been uttered against me in the king's presence, I am not guilty of any of them.
... until he writes that ....
May it not happen that by the command of the king they succeed in turning me out of the grace of the king, my lord! May this be stated by the mouth of the king, my lord, that I may not be denigrated in the palace of the king, my lord! On the contrary, may the king, my lord, count me as one of his servants, may the mark of the kings' servitude be put on me, and I may not be slighted and humiliated in the eyes of my fellow Babylonians!
May I see a sign from the king, my lord, and may we get confident through it! Then we, myself, my brothers, my sons and my friends, shall come and kiss the feet of the king, our lord, and serve the king, our lord.
May I hear of the well-being of the king, my lord, and rejoice.

As of now, Fort Šama'unu is abandoned. There is nobody there except 200 scratch soldiers, and there is no food there except for the travel provisions which they carry with them. Moreover, they have cut off the water between us and the land of Rašu. Nobody from Rašu has (been able to) come to you.
However, I have spoken with the sheikhs of GN, of Dummuqu, and of GN. All of them are servants of the king, my lord. They have sent their letters to the king, my lord, with my messenger.
It may not be postponed until later! May the army reach us quickly, so that I can give the whole country back to the king, my lord!
The king, my lord, should not say: " You wrote me once, and I sent you troops; what did you give me as compensation?"
Abi-yaqar, the Puqudean, does not wish the recovery of the land in the king's presence, he is looking for revenge. He has changed the timetable which he had set. Obliging poverty and robbery, he is (thinking) to take booty for himself. He does not wish the clasping of hands.
So, I am sitting in my house with Indabiya, the chiliarch, trodden down. If not, I would have delivered the fortified place to the king.
The captive Elamite held in Abi-yaqar's prison, who knows my affairs and had heard (them) in the presence of Abi-yaqar and seen my letter — Abi-yaqar's palace manager released him for one mina of silver. And when he came, he testified for me before the legate of Rašu so we were not killed, but our sons are being held as hostages.
Now the whole country has raised its hand towards the king. May the army come and take its hand! I swear by Bel and Zarpanitu, Nabû and Marduk, the wise one, that the words which we have sent to the king our lord in this letter are true, out of our heart.

Your servant Bel-iqiša: I would gladly die for Sargon, the king of the universe, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king! Say to the king, my lord: I pray daily to Bel and Nabû for the good health of the king, my lord.
The king did not listen to any of the earlier reports that we sent to the king, my lord. Now after the delegates of Bit-Dakuri of one accord had written to Merodach-Baladan, and the šandabakku together with Nabû-le'i the governor and the troops of Bit-Yakin had marched to (Bab)-bitqi and the prefect had turned the charioteers of Bit-Dakuri, the Arameans and the men of Bit-Dakuri against him (= Merodach-Baladan), the delegates have been silent, because they have become afraid. The others, having heard (the news), have retreated.
But the leading men who do not keep the land in order and to whose words the king has listened, after making their views public, are now incessantly sending deceitful messages and fortifying their cities. The king should not wait for the outcome! The army should come to Bab-bitqa. And before the army comes, the following message from the king should be brought to the prefect and Ana-Nabû-taklak:
" According to what I have heard, Merodach-Baladan is doing repair work in Larak and is settling Hasinu, the Yašumean, with his family and his Arameans there. (That is why) I am now sending the army to you. Together with the army, lead Da'ini and his Larakeans, who are with you, to Larak so he can enter it, until I arrive personally."
They will listen carefully and not refuse, and the king will attain his objective. We for our part have written to the king what we know. The king may do as he wishes.
Should the king do thus, the king could also say: " I have made the land great again and have built a powerful fortress on the border of the lands." I have written to the king because I am desperate! The king should not hesitate, for we are now at our limits, and your servants and the land of Akkad threaten to slide out of your hand. The message is due to distressful danger. Now ... Imra...

To the king, my lord: your servant Aqar-Bel-lumur. Good health to the king, my lord! Say to the king, my lord:

Furthermore, I have heard that Nabû-hamatua — and he has troops with him — has ... marched downstream all the way to the Litamu. Firstly, they are saying: " Why do the Assyrians keep attacking our towns? We shall go and attack the cities of Bit-Dakuri."
Secondly, it is being said that they say: " Isn't it actually good that he (Nabû-hamatua) came? When they pull themselves back, we shall have entered Babylon."
Furthermore, I have heard that they have established a mutual rule: No one may draw back and go against the towns of Assyria

To the king, my lord: your servant Lanšê. Good health to the king, my lord!
Concerning the murderers of the Babylonians of whom the king, my lord, wrote, whenever the canal is open for the Hindareans, they speak lies!
Now then I have, instead of the murderers, handed over to the Babylonians two Hindareans and one (subject) of Abi-hasâ. I have at the same time handed over to the Babylonians the mothers of the Rasitu tribe.
To the king, our lord: your servants Nabû-šumu-lišir and Aqar-Bel-lumur. Good health to the king, our lord! Say to the king, our lord: the fortress and the armed forces of the king are well. The king, our lord, can be glad.

To the king, his lord: your servant, Šama'gunu. Good health to the king, my lord!
Concerning the guard of which the king, my lord, wrote: " Appoint NN over the guard of the Qa'iš-šumateans!" —
He will repair the crack on the damaged foundations and will eagerly go to the guard under Šarru-amuranni and Kalumu.
Once before I sent messengers to the swindlers in Elam. (As) they returned, they told me that Balassu (and) Kurrala'u are with the legate of the land Raši, and ... Nabû-tuklassu-ana-... (and) Kiburti are in the presence of the king of Elam. And after they had heard that Babylon would plead, they became very angry. And like decoys ... they settled with them. ...
He will care for the guard eagerly.
Perhaps he also will do what is not ... and ....
I will seek ... among them for the ... of the king, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant Lanšê. Good health to the king, my lord! Say to the king, my lord, for the well-being of the king, my lord:
Now, concerning the people of whom the king, my lord, wrote: " They are servants of Zeru-ibni; give them back to him!" — there are no servants of Zeru-ibni in (my) presence. In reality, the two men are Damuneans, vanguards of the king, my lord.
Their brothers ...
Zeru-ibni to ...
In case a word ...
and the men here ...
both and ...
they are (my) friends and owners of ...
I have handed them over with the forces (sent) to the governor of Damascus. If it is agreeable to the king, my lord, I shall give Zeru-ibni soldiers for the people, or, at the king my lord's command, people for people. There are however no servants of his in (my) possession.
To Sargon, king of the universe: thus say your servants Ha'il-il and Zabdi-il, who guard the fortress of Šabhanu for the king, their lord. The king's fortress is well. Good health to the king, our lord!
The letter(s) which Nabû-taklak sends to the king — it is not Nabû-taklak (himself) but his delegates who write them. And what they are (now) writing to the king, viz., " Remove the prefect from Bit-Dakuri!" — the king should write to them: " Why do you write (about) injustice? If he is doing injustice to you, bring ...!"
... they are going
... against them ...
... that is why they write to the king: "..."
... " We are ..."
" We shall nourish them in the house of the king."
Let the king write to the prefect that he should place his messenger in Bit-Tammeš-šama' to keep the barley for the king.
To the chief eunuch, my lord, your servant Bel-ibni. May Nabû and Marduk bless my lord!
Initially, when I did not come to the audience of the king, there were men who came from Elam to see the king and who, in order to obtain intercession for themselves, libelled me in the palace. There was also a certain opponent of mine who said and wrote to the palace bad things about me from Elam. When I heard of this, I did not come, because I was afraid. Now (however), I have become desirous of serving the king.
All those who initially committed a crime have been forgiven by the king. (As to) all the libels that have been uttered against me in the palace, I am not guilty of any of them. Now, should there be a misdemeanour of mine, let my lord speak for me to the king so that he will forgive me and I can come and kiss the feet of the king and of my lord.
... until he writes that ....
May it not happen that by the command of the king they succeed in turning me out of the grace of the king, my lord! Let my lord make no mistake, and may nobody worsen my reputation in the palace! May it be stated by the mouth of the king, my lord, that I may not be denigrated in the palace of the king, my lord! On the contrary, may the king count me as one of his servants, may the mark of the kings' servitude be put on me, and I may not be slighted and humiliated in the eyes of my fellow Babylonians!
May I see just one single sign from the king, my lord, and may we get confident through it! Then we, myself, my brothers, my sons and my friends, shall come and kiss the feet of the king, our lord, and serve the king, our lord.
May my lord read whatever I say and speak for me favourably in the presence of the king. May I hear the well-being of the king, my lord, and rejoice!
I have grasped the hand of the chief eunuch, my lord. May I not come to shame!
To the king, my lord: your female servant Barsipitu. Good health to the king, my lord!
Under the protection of the gods of the king, our lord, we arrived safe and sound at Bit-Dakuri. Ana-Nabû-taklak and the entire population of Bit-Dakuri rejoiced in our presence, and they keep blessing the king, our lord: " Now we know that the king our lord has rehabilitated Bit-Dakuri and will put it to the lead, as he has sent us the son of our lord! And we shall forever live under the protection of the king, our lord."
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-šumu-lišir. Good health to the king, my lord! Say to the king, my lord:
I prepared everything for the journey of Abu-eriba, the king's relative, and his wife, and they have now arrived.
Abu-eriba has been given a kusītu-gown, a woollen cover, a threaded work dress of Tukriš, bracelets worth 1/3 shekels gold, 2 silver dishes, 35 dependents, 2 female singers, 1 horse, 2 camels, 4 donkeys, 20 cows, 300 sheep and 1 wagon; and his wife was provided with jewellery worth 2/3 minas of gold. She with all her lady staff ... was dressed in garments.
All his men too were robed (in purple) and provided with silver bracelets.
Aqar-Bel-lumur and his wife have given an order to Abu-eriba: " As soon as you have gone back, speak maliciously of Nabû-šuma-lišir in the palace!" Perhaps he will speak maliciously of me in the palace. The king, my lord, should know that the order came from our house.
To the king, my lord: your servant Badâ. Good health to the king, my lord! Say to the king, my lord:
The king, my lord, has done me more favours than to all the countries. My name has become respectable under the protection of the king, my lord. I promise to return the favours that the king, my lord, has done.
... that under the protection ...
may come to an end ...
Should the king, my lord, say: "..."
May the king, my lord ... quickly send Nabû-... here by mule express, so that he may speak with my servants and encourage them. Let him gird the loins of Aqar-Bel-lumur, and let him be .... Let him appoint my servants in his charge, so he himself may come here and honour the king, my lord!
No one fulfills on the king's commands as I do, apart from Aqar-Bel-lumur. He will carry out all the king's plans and deliver everything to the king, my lord.
I have written to the king seven times out of necessity. The king, my lord, has given the houses of all those men whose fathers are dead to their sons. Now these are fatherless servants who are loyal to the king. Let him not abandon his servants! Let him not destroy the house of a royal servant!
Your servant Marduk-naṣir: I would gladly die for the vizier, my lord! May Anu and Ištar bless the vizier, my lord! Say to the vizier, my lord:
The caravan from Lahiru arrived on the thirteenth of the month Tammuz (IV). The sons of Ina-tešî-eṭir, from the house of Ṣullulu, brought wool from Bit-Imbiya.
They say: " Now the palace herald and the entire army of Upper Elam are at Bit-Imbiya. They are crossing a ford on the river Abani."
I have sent the news to the vizier, my lord. May my lord command at the palace that troops be positioned opposite them at Der until the king has attained his objective.
Tablet of Šuma-ukin to Nergal-naṣir:
(Concerning) what you wrote, " Give Arrabatu to Qallatu!" — Binitu, Tu'atu, Huluttu and Arrabatu (already) are at her disposal. Why did you during these 8 years think of Arrabatu (only now)?
(As to) what you wrote earlier, " You gave me silver during good times of the land, but during the destruction of the land you took it back" — what you wrote is correct. But as to the payment of silver that you made:
In the second year of King Merodach-Baladan, the silver that you wanted to have, (namely) 10 minas, was given to the Cuthaeans by Ina-qibi-Bel and Nabû-ušallim son of Ni....
In addition, the dame Namirtu was given 10 minas by Lu-ha'il and Bel-naṣir; 3 minas were weighed to Erešu son of Dabibu, the supervisor of Bel-naṣir; 6 minas (were given) to Ašaredu son of Ṭabiya; 1 mina to Nabû-šarra-uṣur, the messenger of the king; 1 mina to Erešu, the messenger of the king of Elam, 10 shekels to ... ê; and 1 2/3 minas to the Urukeans placed at your disposal.
1 mina is the price of the she-camels that was given to Sagibi, 1 mina and 1/3 shekels are in the hand of Ima'in the eunuch, 1/3 mina and 5 shekels were weighed for Dummuqu son of Ir'anni.
Finally, there are 5 minas silver brought to Namirtu by Ṣillâ son of Belaya and ... silver that ... in the second year of Merodach-Baladan. Until now
... silver of the eunuchs
... of the eunuch and silver
... as an interest-free loan
... as an advance payment
... you did not give it.
These words are not yours, they are Bel-naṣir's.
Why ... to ... to ...?
Tablet of Ummaniša to his brother Šama'gunu. Good health to my brother!
Aya-saggî and his travel companion, whom you sent here, did not come to me. Having been captured in the city centre, Aya-siggi was taken to me. He says: " I was sent to you." (However) he had no letter with him. I kept him with me until I saw your messenger. Now I have sent him to you with your messenger.
They say: " Keep an eye on him so that he cannot come back here. If he comes, he must bring a letter with him. Otherwise he may not come."
Both kings have made peace with each other. And each of us has settled in his parental house. Now Immaštašu, the legate of the town Hamu, will come over and settle in Hamu. Appoint his helpers there permanently as well.
Let the evildoers not come and take away his property.
You yourself may not go away, neither are we allowed to leave. The king could (otherwise) hear about it and say: " I must take one more town."
Tablet of Nabû-taklak to Gadiya', his brother. Good health to my brother!
As to what my brother wrote: " May you be in good spirits!" How could I be in good spirits! The enemy has pitched camp over against us, we assemble for fight day and night, and none of you has come to my help! I am not in good spirits at all! (But) really, you must be in good spirits yourself! You live in your lords' house, you eat bread and drink beer comfortably in the house of your lord!
Now then I am writing to you: Let 200 horses (and) 1,000 soldiers ... Yakin come ... the town Im ba!
Perhaps a messenger will come to you from the palace. Tell him to be circumspect and come to the guard.
Your servant Amel-Nabû: I would gladly die for the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! Say to the king, my lord:
The king, my lord, can be glad. The palace, the magnates (and) the guard of ... are well. There are no reports on Elam.
Whatever portents there have been, have all come for the city Qibi-Bel. I have heard it being said: " Now Qibi-Bel is to be destroyed and he is to go to the fortress of Yakin." All existing towns
... Qibi-Bel
... the lower fortress

have been deported.
Tablet of Nabû-dan to Nabû-šuma-iškun:
Why haven't I seen you at the camp for the past two years? And since you haven't seen my house either, by Bel, the tribute of the past two years is incumbent on you.
Tablet of Kinâ to Nergal-naṣir, my brother: I am well, may my brother be well too!
It can't be true that my brother is severely ill! Now ...

(As to) the ostrich egg(s) of which my brother wrote to me, by Bel and Nabû, they are not available in Nippur.
Your servant Kalbi-Ukû: I would gladly die for the king, my lord! Good health to the king, my lord. Say to the king, my lord: I am herewith sending a tablet for the well-being of the king, my lord.
Concerning the noblemen of whom the king wrote: " Write (their names) down!" I shall now write them down, however many (or) few (they be).
To NN, my brother: thus says Kinnâ, your brother. Good health to you! Say to my brother:
Concerning Haza'-il of whom you wrote: " If you catch him, I will give you as an equivalent a horse or a donkey or a sheep" —
... Haza'-il ...
your messenger ...
Haza'-il ...
He has not come here ....
This is the truth. I have now entrusted NN with the following (order): "...!" Perhaps he will return to his family. If he returns, I shall arrest him and give him to my brother.
... this. Now NN, his family (member), ... a donkey. If you want it, send (someone) here to lead it away.
The city and the guard of the king, my lord, are well.
When I wrote to Il-iada', " Send oil and cress here so that I can give to the king's servants," he refused to give them. Furthermore:
Nabû-na'id, a ' temple-enterer' of the temple, planned a crush against the city, saying " I will have the city destroyed!"
Your servant Marduk-šuma-iddina: I would gladly die for the king, my lord! Say to the king, my lord: I have sent my messenger to greet the king, the horses and the soldiers.
Concerning the Hatalleans of whom the king wrote: " Send (word) that 10 men from their midst should come to me" —
the king's bodyguard having come to me, I sent (word) and the Hatallaeans came to me. I have given 10 men to the hands of the bodyguard of the king, my lord.
Your servant Nabû-ušallim: I would gladly die for the king, my lord! Say to the king, my lord:
Concerning the Arameans of whom the king, my lord, wrote, there are among them Arameans, who came from Uruk. They are now on the shore of the channel of Merodach-Baladan.
... among them
have proceeded
... they have gone
... I/he have examined
... of Barik-il
... none of them ran away and came to the king, my lord. By the gods of the king, my lord, none of those who have received favours from the son of Yakin has heard anything benevolent from him!
The king, my lord, should uproot them so the land can be happy. They should not harass the servants of the king, my lord! They are not reliable.
Your servant Nabû-bel-šumate: I would gladly die for the king, my lord! Say to the king, my lord: I have sent my messenger to (ask for) the well-being of the king, the horses and the soldiers.
Concerning Nirgî about whom the king wrote, I am now sending Nirgî
... of the king, my lord,
... anybody ...
... Nergal-..., son of Ana-Nabû-taklak
... they will weave them competently.
If the king, my lord, wishes, let him write to me, so they will weave the gowns and bring them to the king, my lord.
Your servant Nabû-bel-šumate: I would gladly die for the king, my lord! Say to the king, my lord: I have sent my messenger to (ask for) the well-being of the king, the horses and the soldiers.
Certain Babylonians, the Guzummaneans, have come from Babylon, saying: " The son of Yakin has gone from Babylon to Dur-Yakin on the 11th day of Marchesvan (VIII)." I heard these news on the 15th day. Therefore I sent them to the presence of the king, my lord, without a night's rest.
Perhaps the king will say: " Why did you not ... in Bit-Yakin ...?" By the king's gods, even before I heard this news, those ... and those two soldiers of the ... (and) of the prefect whom I have sent

Your servant Belšunu: I would gladly die for the vizier, my lord! May Marduk and Zarpanitu bless my lord! Say to my lord:
Certain Babylonians, members of the nobility, friends who are loyal to the king and the vizier, my lord, have written to me from Babylon. Send us good news, whatever is appropriate!
Whenever Nabû-ahhe-eriba goes out to the bridges at their command, the son of Nabû-ahhe-eriba opposite to ......
He (= Bel) has ordained that the son of Yakin be ousted from Babylon, and he has also spoken about the king's entry to Babylon.
Perhaps Bel will act so the king can perform a ritual and hear him. Let my lord do everything possible so the army can come here and the king will attain his objective. I am one who blesses my lord. I pray daily to Marduk and Zarpanitu for the good health of my lord.
Your servant NN: I would gladly die for the vizier, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless my lord! Say to my lord:
My lord must not say, " Why have I not heard his report and seen his message for a long time?" I have been imprisoned for two years, and even now, after I have been set free, I could not make any plans. When I was set free, I prayed to Bel and Nabû for the good health of the king, my lord, and of the vizier, saying, " When will the king, my lord, come here and establish the protection of Babylon?"
All Babylonians have daily confidence in this. Now, as the prefect has left Bit-Dakuri, the whole of Babylon lives in fear, saying, " We have been handed over to the dogs." Why is my lord silent, while the whole of Babylon (pleadingly) raises its hands towards my lord? (Any)one whom Marduk has given something and whose property has been created, will give Bel an exceptionally good present. (And) the present which he gives is as good as a Babylonian, if it is pleasing to Bel.
Why does my lord remain silent, while Babylon is being destroyed? Šamaš and Marduk have installed you for intercession in Assyria. Persuade the king to come here and to exempt Babylon for Marduk, and (make) your name everlasting in Esaggil and Ezida!
To the king, our lord: your servants Nabû-šumu-lišir and Aqar-Bel-lumur. Good health to the king, our lord! Say to the king, our lord: the fortress and the troops of the king are well. The mood of the people of the land is good. The king, our lord, can be glad.
Concerning the news of the son of Yakin: he is in Babylon.
As to the news of ...

The messengers of the king should now quickly come to us. Then we will come quickly, see the king, our lord, and get confident. May we become happy under the protection of the king, our lord!
The ... will return 20 .... " The troops of the king of Akkad and the king of Elam did not stand up before the king of Assyria."
And if he goes to Babylon, let my brother not tarry entering and be not negligent but care for the future and enter Babylon quickly. When he has entered Babylon, he will have set foot on the centre of the lands. And after it, he will achieve his objective.
All the people of Bit-Dakuri have left the cities and gone into the marshes. Countless barley and dates have been left back. Horses should go and stay (there) because of this.
... said to me: "... the servants are not unoccupied, and they will not give your men to you."
Now he did not return my men to me, but said this in the presence of the king, my lord.
After the king had retreated from Der, at that time, when the Luhayati started hostilities with the Iašubeans, they attacked the wall (and) burnt all the fortresses of the king. They attacked the men of the governor of Mazamua.

Normally, after the ... of the king have survived and those who are in the enemy land decide to go back to Assyria from the enemy land, a messenger of the king sets out in advance from the enemy land and comes to his servant; he hears of the well-being of the king, his lord, and his heart is revived under the protection of the king, his lord.
Now, why is it that the king our lord has entered his house in well-being, but a messenger of the king has not come to these dogs?
Our heart became afraid and worried and is constantly troubled: " We have been neglected."
Right and left ..., are they not saying: " These dogs ....... Their lord does not ......."
May we quickly see the king's messenger, so that our hearts may be soothed under the protection of the king.
Your servant Gabbaru. I would gladly die for the king, my lord! Say to the king, my lord:

Now, after I have been twice to the audience of the mighty king, I am beginning to regain my dignity again. My lord will perhaps say: " For destruction, we need not be renewed." Now Šulâ, the haruspex in Dur-Šarrukin, and Aqar-Nabû, (both) servants of the king, (my) lord, know all our affairs from the beginning. The king may ask them if I wasn't always a serf of the king, my lord, (both when) small and (when) big.
Perhaps my lord will say: " Knowledge ...." The house of your father ....

What is your wish that has not been achieved? When the king, our lord, came, the city was dead. In a proverb it is said: " A carpenter should take ... your pine-wood chips from your poor property."
... When I for the second time went to the audience of the mighty king, he did not discuss my case with me. The king may act as he sees fit. His wish .... How (is it), if you have done everything and ...?

Now, the king gave me my land with the following words: " I shall not choose anything (from it)." But now, as I have nothing left, I shall die. There is no barley left for my nourishment and for my seed grain. If I have sinned, I should have died. Why does the king, my lord, let me live, while Mannu-ki-Urbail is up to destroy me? Verily ...

I have made inquiries. After he wrote to the son of Yakin, Kuttiya, the son of Šarrani, wanted to return to his presence. He did not agree but gave him 40 minas of silver and spoke to him with these words: " I have already given you 40 minas of silver. And now I will give you 10 minas of silver and send you back to the son of NN.

their crimes have been forgiven by the king. (As to) all the libels that have been uttered against me in the palace, which he has heard, I am not guilty of any of them! Now, should there be a misdemeanour of mine, let my lord speak for me so that the king will forgive me and I can come and kiss the feet of the king and of my lord, do service to the king and to my lord, and be one who blesses the king and my lord before Bel, Nabû and Zarpanitu.
Those men who in the beginning came from Elam and libelled me to the king, are not sparing anyone. May it not happen now that by the command of the king they succeed in turning me out of the grace of the king! Let my lord make no mistake, may nobody worsen my reputation in the palace! May it be stated by the mouth of the king, my lord, that I may not be denigrated in the palace of the king! On the contrary, may the king count me as one of his servants, may the mark of the kings' servitude be put on me, and I may not be slighted and humiliated in the eyes of my fellow Babylonians!
May I see just one sign from the king, and may we get confident through it!

On the 8th of Kislev (IX), on the eve of the 9th day, a messenger of Šamaš-belu-uṣur, the legate of Der, arrived on a passageway horse. (While) the people of Zitta were organizing help, he said: " Go up to the fortified place! The king of Elam is (marching) against you!"
When we said to him, " Proceed against him! Tell us, why are you organizing help?" he said: " I am under orders to call (people) to arms from wheresoever, and I have called to arms everybody from the trail of Der as far as the mouth of the river of Nergal." When we heard this, we strengthened the guard ...; all the people of the country were crowded together .......

When there was ......, we brought bowmen and shieldmen ... into the king's fort, wrote down letters and dispatched them to the king, our lord. Lulla-Bel too ...... dispatched letters .......
On the xth day, the messenger came (back) ... on horseback, saying: " There is nothing to worry about! They have gone up to the territory of the Elamites, taken land as far as Bit-Ha'iri, and returned." We sent (word) and had the letters which we had dispatched to the king, our lord, returned, thinking: " Should the king, our lord, read (lit., ' hear') them, he would get startled." In case they bring in the message of Lulla-Bel, the king, our lord, should not believe the content of the message. There is nothing is to worry about; the king, our lord, can be at ease.
As to the work on the river of Bit-Deraya which the king, our lord, ordered to be dammed — the king, our lord, knows that last year and the year before it the people of the country were many, and they were brought out and worked on it like one farmer. But now the people of the country are few and (...), and we have not worked on it earlier. The days have arrived, but all the people are sulky and do not act according to their hearts. The king, our lord, will say, " They shall do the work! They shall have no claim!" (But) they do not obey us, so we cannot do the work. May the king act best as he can.
With the Urhulu, Damunu and Aradatu (tribes) ...... ... is not angry. We fear the king, our lord, and shall never place a woe on them! May the king, my lord, act best as he can.
I pray daily to Bel and Nabû for the joy of heart and the health of the king, my lord. The king, my lord, can be very glad indeed. Esaggil and Babylon are truly well and in good shape.

When I came to Marad, the Maradeans sent a messenger to NN
I said to the royal eunuch: " I shall never move garrison troops to Bit-Dakuri!" Afterwards they have not obeyed me.
I have given out the food rations and the flour. Now Nabû-ereš and his soldiers are guarding the fortress.
Your servant Marduk-apla-iddina: I would gladly die for the king, my lord! Say to the king, my lord:
As to what the king wrote: " When you sent your soldiers (and) they penetrated into the inner city, they covered the temple wall with arrows" —
My soldiers gave one another the following orders: " Nobody may wound anybody, and the herald may not call up anybody!" Did they not give (such) orders to one another for fear of the name of God (lit., ' gods')? Why should we be against the people, and why should there be an arrow on the temple wall?
My men, who attacked and stood by the temple wall — I myself stationed them there. How could an(y) bow have hit the temple wall?
With regard to Zakir, of whom the king wrote: " Who is he?" — I already wrote to the king: " His father put in a good word for me, saying, ' Verily you did not get in touch with my quarter ... from ..., your men ... are reliable.'"

Later on, as soon as the king has defeated his enemies and has come to Babylon and kissed the ground in front of Marduk and Zarpanitu, we shall send him every information that we hear.
We shall say all the news to NN word by word. He will then speak to the king, our lord, then come out (again) and say to us: " The king is your lord! Fear not!" Later on, as soon as the king, our lord, has gone to Dur-Yakin, we shall send him all the news that we hear. Bel-išdiya-kini, the mungu-commander, who ... the horses.

Every day, from the unlocking of the door socket until the closing of the gate, I bless the king, my lord, with raised hands before Bel and Beltiya.
The bread is excellent, the best quality beer is good. The door of the god of the dead one has been put up. The plating is ready, and all the Babylonians who on the 4th day went up to Esaggil and saw the door, blessed the king, my lord, before Bel and Beltiya, and rejoiced greatly. The king, my lord, can be happy. The door of Esaggil and Babylon, your house of god, is very beautiful.
But I myself am not happy. I am loyal, but my food ration has been held back. The king will perhaps say: " Who has withheld it?" The ' ear-men' who go ...

Let the vizier send a bribe to the governor that he should deport them. The messengers of the Puqudeans, who live in the Qatannu marsh, go daily to the son of Yakin. The vizier may also write to the governor that he should lead Sagibi-ilu, the Amukanean who lives in Bit-re'î, to them.

If, (on the other hand), he does not deliver them into the hands of my lord, then my lord may know that his heart is not with my lord.

When they came to me and dragged away fifty (stone) steps, they kept cutting off their foliage until I reached them. They went away, (but) did it again.
Now when they came (again), they carried off as booty two ' third-men' of the king. I do know that you ordered the sortie and I do know that the king had appointed them.
The king, our lord, says: " You must not take booty from them." But you are assuredly coming and taking booty from our city!

They covered his face with his cloak and made him stand before Arda-Mullissi himself, saying: " Look! Your appeal is being granted, say it with your own mouth!" He said: " Your son Arda-Mullissi will kill you."
They uncovered his face, and after Arda-Mullissi had interrogated him, they ... for him and his brothers.
When ... four men — Ṣuhru, Ṭabiya, NN, and NN — told it to Nabû-aha-ereš, he did not believe it. He should question the men of the house of Arda-Mullissi.

If I have committed a crime against the king, my lord, (then) I do not know what my crime is.
These seven years I have been held in durance vile. Without the king, they have taken my estate (and) destroyed my property. I am dying of hunger in my imprisonment.
There are many who have sinned against the king, my lord, but the king has excused them and spared their lives. Even a deportee is allowed to live.
I am neither a sinner nor an evildoer. Do not let me die of hunger in my imprisonment! May the lord of kings allow me to live!
We entered into a treaty with the king, your father, and we have entered into a treaty with the king, our lord. Furthermore, the king has written to us, saying: " Write to me (about) whatever you see or hear."
When the people of Uruk saw those men who had committed a crime against the king in Uruk, they wrote to us, and we wrote to the king about what they said. Now then we have brought the criminals and the witnesses into the king's presence. If it is agreeable to the king, let the king question them.
There are matters relevant to the king which I have heard. A royal messenger should come out to question me.
Zera-ukin, Labaši's son, says: " If the king, my lord, hears the matter which I have heard, he will devastate the lands." Now then he has come with a son of Ina-teši-eṭir. The king should summon him and question him before he is abducted and done away with.

Concerning Re'indu of the household of the šandabakku about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me, I looked for her in Babylon but did not find her (there). Having asked and made enquiries, (I found) she was living in Dilbat. I have (now) brought her in from Dilbat and am herewith sending her to the king, my lord, in the hands of Na'id-ilu, the eunuch who brought the (king's) seal(ed letter) to me.

As to what the king, our lord, wrote to us: "... to ...!" — The king, our lord, knows whether we have ever left our watch or been negligent in our watch since the king, our lord, appointed us to our watch. The territory before us is extensive. Five stages of territory square, forty length units, is the stretch of a watch for cavalry with archers. We have several times written to the house of our lords about the horses. Now we are keeping watch with archers (only) and praying to the gods of the king, our lord.

Now then we are keeping the watch which the king, our lord, assigned to us, and we are praying to the gods of the king, our lord.

I had settled and promised him, he gave half a ' litre' of bread. To each of his deaf ones, he gave one ' litre' of bread (and) plants.
He said to them as follows: " Do ...!" A Hamurean deaf man said to him: " Aššur-balassu-iqbi has not been present (but) has reduced my bread (allowance)."
Gumāta told me: " In my city, there is much honey, wine, bread (and) ...; open it and take it!" I was unwilling; (and) when I did open it by the king's order and out of hunger, my bread was finished.

(Only) rites that are written down in scripture are our rites. They have been performed by our forefathers, and they meet the needs of the king. (There are) a hundred, (nay,) a thousand (rites) which, as far as I am concerned, would be suitable for the purification of the kings, my lords. But, because they are not our rites, they are not recorded in scripture.
Why do these men hatefully misadvise the king, my lord, and (why) do they have this attitude towards us?

No provisions are laid in there, and whatever dates they had, the Puqudeans have carried them all off . But when we wrote to the šandabakku, saying: " We will help ourselves from one thousand (kor of) barley," he refused, (although) he has harvested a large crop.
The king, my lord, should enquire ... whether during (all) those years (when) an official of the king, my lord, was appointed in Nippur, I did not every year bring in one thousand (kor of) barley and deliver them to the servants of the king in Nippur.

..., messengers ... of the king of Elam came to us, saying: "...

But we ... sent them back, so their messenger would not come to us.
When they saw that we were holding his messengers, they brought in Nabû-ušallim, the son of Merodach-Baladan, settled him among the Targibateans, and gave him the Nahaleans, the Duteans, and the Bananu, Na'id-Marduk's frontier region.
And again a messenger of the king of Elam has come to us, saying: " The sons ... their ... a man their battle ... Nabû-ušallim should be made your lord, let him become your superior in the land. But perhaps you will say: ' Na'id-Marduk (is it)!' I know the news of Na'id-Marduk better than .... Na'id-Marduk is dead. Whether you like it or not, I am going to bring in Nabû-ušallim and make him your superior. You are my men. Henceforth, the king of Assyria does not rule over you."
As soon as Nabû-ušallim reached the Targibateans, he captured one of our men who guard the outpost in Nahal and sent him to the king of Elam. The king of Elam has spoken to him and sent him to us, saying: " Go and say to the Sealand(ers): ' You have no case with the king of Assyria. You are my men.'"
Now then we have sent the messenger to the king, our lord. Let him tell the king, our lord, everything that the king of Elam wrote to us.
So perhaps the Elamites will (now) march against us. Let the king give an order to the Chaldeans, so that they come to our aid. May he listen to nobody else ... with regard to us. We are the the king's servants.
The king of Elam sent a messenger to us. Now we have sent him to the king, our lord. The king should listen to what he says.

Having listened to one another, the king of Elam and the king of Assyria have made peace with one another at Marduk's command and become treaty partners. (Yet) you have detained there all the men of the country that came to the festival.

The king has sent a letter to me, saying: " They must come." So send them quickly!
May my lord agree to present ... to Nergal and Laṣ for the preservation of his life, and may he be an intercessor and speaker of a good word for Cutha in the presence of the king.

Ammini-ilu, a merchant from Tema, was going from here to the king of Babylon. He was arrested at the city gate of Sippar, and is in fetters in Dur-Šarrukku. Let them fetch him and question him. Nobody from here knows him, and the king should not say: " Why didn't I hear these things?"

All the former and later rumours which I have written to the king, my lord, I have heard from the commandant of Kish and from Zakir. I wrote to the king, my lord, what they had to say.

Zerutiya brought in Bel-ipuš and Bel-bulliṭ from Dilbat, (but) the king did not listen to what they said, and Ṣillaya has cunningly returned them to Dilbat, telling them to mobilise archers. If they have not mobilised archers, shouldn't he mobilise some, if there are none? He sends back men who have come to him, telling himself: " They should not make my affairs known and no witnesses against me should stay here." May the king ask Zerutiya why he brought them in.
Zerutiya (also) brought in Bel-ahhe-Marduk, a legal adversary of Bel-iddin, (but) nobody brought him to the court, (and) Ṣillaya has annulled the case. The king should ask him why he came.

Nabû-zera-iddin, a citizen of Borsippa, allied himself with Ṣillaya and they made Nabû-ušezib, the Puqudean, into an enemy. Also, he was active in the palace of Sippar, saying: " I am a haruspex."
Ever since the lord of kings installed me in Borsippa, I have been looking for him but have not found him. No one who sins against the lord of kings escapes. Now, under the aegis of the lord of kings, he has fallen into my hands and I am herewith sending him to the lord of kings, my lord.

Why is it that I have more than once petitioned the king, my lord, but nobody has questioned me, as if the name of the land of Akkad were not good in the eyes of the king, my lord, and as if I had sinned against the king, my lord?
I have committed no crime against the king, my lord. Before the hostilities (began), I came and invoked the right to appeal to the king about Arrabu, saying, " I have a matter relevant to the palace." He did not fear (the king) but took away my property, (and) having arrested me, put me in custody.
And now, when before all the people I have come and grasped the feet of the king, my lord, this very day I am humiliating myself unto death. The multitudes who are dead are at peace! Since last year nobody gives me food to eat. Hunger and thirst have befallen me. I go and drink water from a well; I wash my feet (there); and I go up to keep the watch of the king, my lord.
Earlier on I wrote on a writing board which I sent king, my lord: " There are men hostile to me here. If they block my access to the king, and if they say evil words about me before the king, the king will kill me."
There are two men who have taken gold against my life. They plot every day to kill and destroy me. If they have succeeded in making evil words about me reach the king, my lord, then the king, my lord, should know (this):
Šarru-lu-dari has done two things that are untoward to the king, my lord. There is a royal edict, " Nobody may administer booty from the land of Akkad without my permission." He (and) the daughter of Babilayu, a member of the Reʾû family, have sinned more than all the lands against the king, my lord. I wrote (about him), but when he returned a field (of mine), he gave it to him(self).
The king appointed a vizier and a chief judge in the land, saying: " Render true and just judgements in my land." Before Šarru-lu-dari was appointed as mayor, the chief judge for a period of time decided my case. He requisitioned the people of my paternal estate as stolen property and gave them to me. When Šarru-lu-dari came, he overturned the judgement concerning me. Now my retainers serve an idle man, and I am dying of thirst.
I argue with him, but he hurls against me twenty or thirty misdeeds which I have neither seen, nor heard, nor known from this household, (and) which he then repeats in arguing with me in the assembly of the servants of the king, my lord.
You, lord of kings, are Marduk whose fury is the Deluge (and) whose glance is a merciful father. Let them give (me) my property, as the chief judge decided, and the property of my paternal estate, so that I may serve the king there.
To the king, my lord: your servant, Kabtiya. Good health to the king, my lord!
Concerning the treaty of Babylon about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, I was not present (because of) the sealed document of the king, my lord, which Aššur-ra'im-šarri brought to me: my brothers and I went and kept watch with him in Raši, (so) I missed the appointed time of the treaty of Babylon.
On the way (home), I went to see the palace supervisor. He took me along, and by your gods, I joined the treaty of the king, my lord, in Nippur and in Uruk.
And do I not rejoice in the treaty of the king, my lord! I say: " (My) men, their sons, and their wives, together with their gods, should (also) enter into the treaty of the king, my lord!"
And (as for) me, in accordance with the order of the king, my lord, when the elders came, they entered into the treaty of the king, my lord, in Babylon.
from under ...
when you mobilised, you ....
Now why have you seized one area (only) and stayed in Nippur?
The former šandabakku s (governors of Nippur) who were there before you, whether they were at ease with their lords or not, were, like you, courtiers of their lords, and their lords' favour obliged them, as it obliges you. Each šandabakku duly mobilised his forces and went with Ṣallaya to where(ver) my grandfather sent him in the whole land of Akkad up to the Sealand.
Now you, too, mobilise your forces and go and join Nabû-eṭir, the governor of the northern Sealand!
Do your work, ..., (and) make your names good in my eyes!
The words which the people of Babylon spoke before the king:
" Ever since the kings, our lords, sat on the throne, you have been intent on securing our privileged status and our happiness. But what of us, who have had our fill of safeguarding those of (our) Elamite, Tabalite and Ahlamite women!
When the kings, our lords, did their elementary studies, the gods bestowed great wisdom and magnanimity on you. " Dimkurkurra, Babylon, (is) the Bond of the Lands." Whoever enters inside it, his privileged status is secured. Also, Babylon (is) " the bowl of the Dog of Enlil." Its (very) name is set up for protection. Not even a dog that enters inside it is killed.
The kings, our lords, know that Eṭiru and his sons grasped the feet of the king of Assyria, your father. Until Šuzubu son of Gahal came and killed them all, they kept kissing the feet of Assyria which they had grasped, and kept the watch of their lord's house. Šuzubu received the heads, arms and feet of Eṭiru (and) his sons together with ... in the presence of Beliya. But the women of ... and Šaddinnu were married in Babylon.
... with them (f.), saying: " She is a woman who goes out." What is wrong (with that)? ...
... all the women of Eṭiru's house ...
carries everything. To ......
the foreign women .......
And in having made our privileged status surpassing ... from all lands, the kings, our lords, have ... more than past kings.
So let the privileged status of the women who ... also be established with us by the name of Babylon, (and) may the favours which the kings, our lords, have done for us, be (thus) brought to a climax.
Under your protection, Bel-bulliṭ (and) ... continue blessing the kings, our lords, every day before Marduk (and) Zarpanitu.
To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant, Itti-Marduk-balaṭu. May the gods of all the lands bless the king, my lord! Although I was a dead dog, the king, my lord, has revived me.
The gods of the king have set out in procession (and) celebrated the festival. The guard of the temple is well. In ...
It is written in the treaty: " Write to me (about) whatever you see or hear."
The sheikhs who were settled over Harmašu have come here. Some of them have certainly gone to Elam. I have (now) written to the king, my lord.
(As to) the horses which the king sent to Uruk, I have harnessed ... and ...
To the king's daughter, my lady: your servant, Nabû-nadin-šumi. I pray every day to Bel, Zarpanitu, Nabû, Nanaya, and Tašmetu for the life of the king of the universe, my lord, and for the life of the king's daughter, my lady.
Zarpanitu, the august lady, has made you happy. Just as I pray to Bel and Nabû for the happiness of the king of the universe, my lord, and of the king's daughter, my lady, (so) may Bel and Nabû turn the happy faces of the king, my lord, and the king's daughter, my lady, towards me.
To the mother of the king, my lord: your servant, Ašaredu. May Nabû and Marduk bless the mother of the king, my lord.
I pray every day to Nergal and Laṣ for the life of the king and of the mother of the king, my lords.
All is well with the city and the temple(s) of the king, and now I am keeping the watch of the king, my lord.
To the king of the universe, my lord: your servant, Aqar-Bel-lumur. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king of the universe, my lord! May Šamaš and Marduk ordain happiness and good health for the king, my lord.
The ' son' of Dakkuru has destroyed my property and has starved my mother and my brothers to death. I sent a letter about him to the king, my lord, but have seen no reply, and (so) have become afraid.
The king knows that I am not provided for here; I have no house and no slave. And the ' son' of Dakkuru has destroyed my records which I had deposited with my mother and my brothers in Babylon. (Thus) I am doubly troubled.
From your holy mouth which Šamaš and Marduk bless, came (this promise): " Your household will increase." Now let it increase under the protection of the king, my lord.
To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant, Nabû-šumu-lišir. May Nabû and Marduk give the king of the lands, my lord, long days and everlasting years.
When I sent men of Birati, servants of the king, my lord, for guard duty to the marshy plain of Babylon and the king of Babylon's men attacked them, by the destiny of the king, my lord, the Biratians, the king's servants, killed four of the king of Babylon's men; and I sent to the king, my lord, the nine (men) whom they brought in.
After Birati was destroyed and its gods were carried off, I was a dead man, but when I saw the gold signet ring of the king, my lord, I came to life. But now, when I sent my messenger to greet the king, my lord, I did not see the signet ring of the king, my lord, and I stopped living. I am a dead man. The king, my lord, must not abandon me!
To the king, my lord: your servant, the šandabakku. May Enlil, Ninurta, and Nusku bless the king, my lord.
The king knows that I am very ill indeed. If I were not ill, I would have come the king's audience. Now I have sent my brother Bel-usati and ten noblemen of Nippur to greet the king, my lord.
The king knows that all the lands hate us because of Assyria. We do not have safe passage in any of the lands. Wherever we go, we get killed with the words: " Why did you grasp the feet of Assyria?" Now we have blocked off my city gates; we do not go out to the open country.
(Yet) we are keeping the king's watch! The vizier and the magnates whom the king sent here, have seen everything. Let them speak to the king! The king must not leave us in anybody's hands.
We have no water. May we not die of thirst! The king, your father, granted us water from the Banitu Canal, saying: " Dig an offshoot of the Banitu Canal to Nippur!" (But) Ṣillaya has shut us off.
Now, may the king send (word) to Ubaru, the commandant of Babylon, that he grant us an offshoot of the Banitu Canal, so we can use the water together with them and not slip from the king's hands because of thirst, and all the lands cannot say: " The people of Nippur who grasped the feet of Assyria had their fill of thirst."
To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant, Marduk. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king of the lands, my lord.
Thanks to Bel and Nabû, who gave dominance to the king of the lands, my lord, your servants, whom you took in your hands, are achievers and not do-nothings. In three months they have done a job which would not be done in three years, and delivered it to the king, my lord.
But perhaps the king, my lord, will say: " He wrote earlier on that the job will not be done. I said in order to further the objective of the king, my lord: " If you seized ..., the king may achieve his objective." Now your gods have acted, and the king has achieved his objective. Moreover, the men who said, " Sippar is a door locked in front of us," have been led into the hands of the king of the lands, my lord.
I have heard the magnates say as follows: " We will set up a camp in Dilbat." If they set up a camp in Dilbat, the people will starve. Also, no caravan will come to them. Rather, their army will go out and plunder a caravan. Let them place the camp within the enclosure of the camp of Babylon of last year, and let boats and water-skins come to them.
There should be 520 (of them) in Cutha. The horses of the king of the lands should be in hiding and thwart their exit from Babylon.
To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant, Nabû-šumu-lišir. May Nabû and Marduk give the king of the lands, my lord, long days, everlasting years, a just sceptre, and an everlasting throne.
Concerning the matter that the king, my lord, gave me orders about, saying, " Send me any news about the Arabs that you hear" —
When that caravan had left (the territory of) the Nabayateans, Aya-kabar, son of Ammi-yata', the Massa'ean, attacked them, killed men and took booty. One of them, having escaped, entered the city of the king.
Now then I am sending him to the king, my lord. May the king listen to what he has to say.
To the king, my lord: your servant, NN. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord.
I heard from your holy mouth which Marduk and Zarpanitu love: " Nobody will ... anything ...."
From the gate of the god ... in ..., (and) when Bel-naṣir, having given a woman to his son, ... ed for food, I ....
Now NN is saying: " I have taken his wife in exchange." They are giving my house, my field, and my wife to Nenea, an exorcist who forsook his lord's house and ran away.
So, although I have always revered the king, my lord, when I am dead, where shall they bury me? There is no city, no open country, no land, no people, nor a single ' litre' of bread (for me) in my lord's house. May my petition to the king, my lord, be received with sympathy!
To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant, Nabû-šumu-lišir. May Nabû and Marduk give the king of the lands, my lord, long days, everlasting years, a just sceptre, and an everlasting throne.
The Arabs attacked the Assyrians, the king's servants who come to Birati to do business, and took away by force fifty Assyrians from Halulê, and with them twenty Biratians, servants of the king.
A man from among them escaped and spoke to me, and by the destiny of the king, my lord, having ......, I inflicted a defeat on them. I impaled x of them in the territory where the attack took place. There were no casualties among the servants of the king.
I attacked (them) again, and having taken prisoner seven of them as informers, I am herewith sending them to the king, my lord. They are friends of Ita'-il, son of Bun-šadadu, priest of Šamaš. The king should question them.
To the king of kings, my lord: your servant, Nabû-ušallim. May Aššur, Šamaš, and Marduk be concerned with the health of the king, my lord.
There are people in the marshes called marsh dwellers. In Šamaš-ibni's time, thirty of their families fled and settled in Bit-Amukani. Together with their brothers they refuse to come close to us. They are the ones who four times last year called in the enemy against us.
If it is agreeable to the king, my lord, let the king write to Kudurru of Bit-Amukani, so that he may lead them away and settle them where the king, my lord, likes. As long as they live in Bit-Amukani, their brothers will not be subdued and they will not do the work of the king, my lord.
To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant, the šandabakku. May Enlil, Ninurta, and Nusku bless the king of the lands, my lord! May Aššur, Enlil, Šamaš, and Marduk grant the king of the universe, my lord, a life of long days, happiness, good health, and an enduring reign and may they ordain a sound foundation of the royal throne of the king, my lord, for far-off days.
Last year after the palace supervisor and the magnates went down to Chaldea, the brothers of the king of Elam kept pushing and inciting the king, their brother: " Let's muster a camp and cross over to Chaldea and remove Chaldea from Assyria's control." The king of Elam did not do wrong; he did not listen to them and did not comply, but said, " I will not disregard the treaty." He restrained them, (and) up to now he has not ... but has stayed awake. They have been waiting for their brother (to yield), however.
Now I have heard that he has relented in their hands (and) listened to them, (and) has gone (and) given orders to the whole of Elam in accordance with their command. They have prepared their travel provisions ...
...... he seeks
... Bit-Imbî
...... his land for flour
... have prepared ... and ... ed travel provisions.
... and his younger brother have gone to the people/man of Ham
... for this Nisan (I).
Having heard (about it), I am herewith writing to the king, my lord. The king, my lord, should know (this).
...-Aššur, son of Nabû-ahu-uṣur, the ... who came into Nippur, has appropriated ... for himself. Having put his hand to it, he is arresting, flogging, and selling free citizens of Nippur. When I spoke to him, he belittled me in the assembly of my country (and) made me look stupid before the people of my country. He keeps behaving wrongfully in the city, (and) is greatly compromis ing the city.
May the king, my lord, send (somebody) to inspect his city and commission him to tell the son of Nabû-ahu-uṣur, his arms being full, to keep ... his hands off Nippur.
To the king, my lord: your servant, Ninurta-aha-.... Good health to the king, my lord!
Ahhešaya, the major domo, and Bel-ittadin, the information officer of Nabû-ušallim from Bit-Dakkuri, are carrying a lot of silver on them. They say they are going to buy horses. The king, my lord, should know (this).
As for the renegade scholars, eunuchs, and soldiers of Šamaš-ibni, who are with Nabû-ušallim, about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me — when I spoke to him, he refused to give them up to me, saying: " I will not give them up to you without a sealed document from the king and without a bodyguard."
Bel-iqiša, son of Bunanu, after visiting Babylon, Borsippa, and Bit-Dakkuri, has secured (many) friends (and) established in-law-relationship with (many) noblemen. He has married his first daughter to Bel-aha-iddin, son of NN ... in Babylon. He has married his second daughter to NN, son of Nadinu, a ' temple-enterer' of Nabû in Borsippa. He has married his third daughter to the son of Zakiru, the chief shepherd of Nabû.
Bit-Hussanni, (a locality) situated on the Pitu watercourse between Cutha and Kish — its (yield of) dates is 100 (kor) and its (yield of) grain 100 (kor) — is a sustenance field of the king. Nabû-dini-amur got it but has given it to Bel-iqiša. It is of the province of Babylon. Neither his father nor his grandfather had the usufruct of it, and it is not in his territory.
Now I have written everything that I have observed to the king, my lord. May the king, my lord, do as he deems best.
To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant, Ninurta-aha-iddin. May Enlil, Mulliltu, Ninurta, and Nusku bless the king of the lands, my lord! May the gods of Ekur and Nippur and the great gods who live in heaven and earth grant the king of the lands, my lord, a life of long days, the satisfaction of a ripe old age, a just sceptre, (and) the shepherding of mankind; and may they give firm positive answers to the king, my lord, and endow the king, my lord, with the direction and care of all lands.
All is very well with the watch over Ekur, the temples of the king, and Nippur. Illil-bani, the king's servant, and all the archers of Nippur with him are on watch where the king assigned him. And to his rear I keep guard for the king, my lord, in the city and the open country.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Why have you not dispatched an answer to the sealed documents that I have more than once sent you?"
... I have dispatched to the king, my lord.

May Aššur, Enlil, and Ninurta let your armed forces see your ...; may they strengthen your weapons and make you victorious over your enemies, because the king, my lord, has revived the heart of his servant.
To the king, my lord: your servant, Šumaya. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord. Good health to the king, my lord!
Didn't the king, my lord, give me an order as follows: " Go and bring the gods to Zanaki and let the people gather to you"? The gods of the king, my lord, made it succeed, and three thousand people came and gathered to me.
When Nabû-šarra-ibni, the prefect, laid hands on the city, ...
Also, there is a guard who has taken a wife from among the Ruṣapeans. He is a Damunean; thirty years ago he married a Zanakian woman. Now he has claimed her, and I have sent him to the king, my lord. The Zanakians take wives from among the Damuneans and the Gambuleans, (and) they are all making claims. The king, my lord, should not act wrongly in this.
By the gods of the king, my lord, I should stay here until Bel sets out in procession. Everyone in this city has become rebellious. A messenger of the king, my lord, should come to give the city confidence and, for myself, to raise my spirits.
May the king ask the governor whether or not my heart is completely devoted to the king, my lord, (and) may the governor stand beside the king, my lord.
To the king of the universe, my lord: your servant, Aqar-Bel-lumur. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king of the universe, my lord.
Lugalmarada of Marad is the brother of Nabû and the brother of Nergal. The king, your father, took away the territory of Marad and, having written it down, placed it (= the relevant document) in Ezida before Nabû. The commandant of Marad used to bring his gift to your father on his own.
Now the ' son' of Dakkuru has taken Marad for himself.
Before he comes (to the reception), the king should ask
... all
... men

NN, his messenger,
(and) Haru..., his ...,
who ... work in ... —
may the king listen to them concerning it.
In the 5 or 6 years that I have been staying in the palace of the king, my lord, has anyone heard from my mouth any matter that the king, my lord, has told me?
In the previous allegations that they have put up against me, the gods of the king, my lord, have taken my hand. Now these words are (mere) allegations, put up against me.
Concerning the intercession for the šandabakku about which the governor of Babylon wrote to the king, my lord, and about which the king, my lord, is saying: " I have installed two eunuchs of mine in the land of Akkad" —
may Bel and Nabû permit the king, my lord, to place a eunuch of his in Elam.
I have not said this word nor made it to be said!
But, they are greatly hindering him.
As for me, what you see (fit), so will I have it done.
To the king, our lord: your servants, the elders of the Sealand. Good health to the king, our lord! May Aššur, Šamaš, and Marduk bless the king, our lord. May they give kingship of the four quarters to the king, our lord.
More than once messengers of Teumman, the king of Elam's brother, of the herald, and of Zineni have come to us, saying: " Come and embrace Nabû-ušallim, your lord's son, so that he may lead you!" We have not agreed but have responded: " Na'id-Marduk, our lord, is alive and we are the servants of the king of Assyria. If you wish his promotion in the land, send him to the king of Assyria and let the king promote him if he likes. Wherever he may be, you will have sent him. We will not do wrong and he shall not become our superior. We will send him in manacles to the king of Assyria."
Now then, they have brought him in, annexed the Targibateans, the Nahaleans, the Duteans, and the Bananu, the border regions of our land, and given them to him. And now his messengers have come to the elders of the Sealand, saying:
" Come up to me and lead (my) forces to the Sealand! And if you do not come up to me and do not say what I command, I will come and destroy your land and your houses. But perhaps you will say: ' We are afraid of the king of Assyria.' I will take care of the king of Assyria."
Having heard it, we are herewith informing the king, our lord.

When Ku nâ came to the presence of the king, my lord, I was staying overnight in Kasappa.
I had left Kasappa and was on my way, (when) messengers came up to me from the city ... (and) gave me the following report about the Gambuleans: " The Gambuleans ... from the presence of Kunâ, son of ..."
I found out the details and I am writing (again) to the king, my lord.
To the king, my lord: your servant, Nabû-bel-šumati. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord.
If not, they will attack them by surprise. I am writing to inform the king, my lord.
As it is said in a popular proverb, " For this day the mother raised (him), and the daughters, too."
Earlier on you (m.) used to say: " I know that you (f.) are alive." But now, the king, my lord, is merciful. He has brought me to you: you have seen me, you know (for sure) that I am alive! Why (then) to eat bread that is not one's own?
Still I recognise that I have become a stranger: I gave you up. What do you eat for your (pl.) health? Let me eat one ' litre' of bread with you!
Observe that the king, my lord, is merciful. In old age ...

Now then our messenger, to whom we gave the letter, saying: " Take it and give it to Nikkal-iddin, saying, ' Fear not! Esarhaddon is firmly seated on the throne,'" diverted the letter, and it was given to Zer-kitti-lišir.

Concerning the news of Belšunu of Bit-Dakkuri about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, he has not treated correctly the messenger whom I sent to him and has not spoken to him. I have heard that he has arrested him.
Šuma-iddin, whom the king, my lord, sent as commandant to Marad, is now before me in Nippur.

I am the king my lord's servant and watchman here. There are many foreign language speakers in Nippur under the aegis of the king, my lord. I implement the king's orders and speak to them.
When I spoke to Aššur-belu-taqqin, the prefect appointed in Nippur to pass on sealed documents and royal messengers, about the sealed documents and the royal servants who come and stay for three or four days in Nippur and whom he refuses to pass on —
when I spoke to him about them, saying: " The people of Nippur and the whole country have discredited me," he raised his hand against me ... and said: " I will cut off your head and hang it by the neck of ...."

The men of the king, my lord, having seen them, I immediately launched a surprise attack on them and took them prisoner. Now then I am sending them to the king, my lord. The king, my lord, should question them.
The king should also ask them, " Who has like ... ... ed a house for sale ...?"

To Aqarâ, his lord: your servant, Šuzubu. May Nabû and Marduk bless my lord.
Doesn't my lord know that I am entering a ruined and abandoned house? When Tabnea, my brother, took six hundred (homers of) barley belonging to our paternal estate, he brought all good feeling between him and his brothers to an end. He received fields from it, but I have received nothing from it. And my lord knows that I cannot beg, and there is nobody to take my hand.
Now, insofar as my lord sees fit, let my lord assign me to the commandant. I should not make a binding agreement away from my lord.
Aplaya, the son of Bel-bulliṭ, a member of the Abunaya family, has filled up (i.e., impregnated?) ..., a young girl of yours. He brought her into the camp as an adult woman, but witnesses convicted him, and they have gone back. And now he has entered under Bel-le'i. Let my lord judge him as he finds best.
A tablet of Bel-upaq to Kunâ, his father. Good health to my father! I pray every day to Nabû and Nanaya for the life of my father, and I steadily do (my) duty for Ezida on behalf of my father.
When I enquired of Mar-Biti about you, he fixed the date of (your) well-being until the fourth day.

To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant, Aplaya. I pray every day to Uraš and Belet-ekalli for the long life, happiness, and good health of the strong king of the universe, my lord.
The sons of Bel-iddin, the sons of an enemy and troublemaker, whom I arrested on the road to Babylon and sent to the king, my lord, and who told the king, my lord: " We are deserters" — their misdeeds towards the king, my lord, are extremely many.
Šulâ, the commandant of Dilbat whom Šamaš-šumu-ukin appointed, is their sister's son. All the Dilbatians who are deserting and ..., are ....
...... behind them
...... their sons ...
I am a friend. When Šamaš-šumu-ukin set out for Kar-Nergal against the camp of the king, my lord, at that time I was in the king's camp.
When Zababa-eriba set out with Šamaš-šumu-ukin, he killed Remanni-ilu, the recruitment officer, and took his clothes. And after he had departed and deserted from Babylon, he kept saying in the camp: " The headgear which is on my head is that of Remanni-ilu, the recruitment officer." The headgear which was on his head and which was taken to the king, my lord, is (indeed) that of Remanni-ilu, the recruitment officer. These men are not friends; they are enemies.
If in these words I have written anything incorrect to the king, my lord, may I die for it.
The king should write to his servants that they should cut off the road between Babylon and Borsippa.
To the mother of the king, my lord: your servant, Na'id-Marduk. Good health to the mother of the king, my lord! May Aššur, Šamaš, and Marduk keep the king, my lord, alive. May they ordain happiness for the mother of the king, my lord.
After the Elamites had marched against us and taken control of the bridge, when they came, I wrote to the mother of the king, my lord. Now they have dismantled the bridge, but have retained the floats of the bridge in .... They have not released them. We do not know whether or not they will go on. If they do, I shall write to the mother of the king, my lord. The forces must reach us, my lord!
The son of Nikkal-iddin has written to the king of Elam and to Huban-nikaš: "... the king of Assyria and his camp ...
The mother of the king, my lord, knows that they are reliable words. Also one of the Chaldeans has written (to me) accordingly.
By the gods of the king, my lord, (I swear) that the messenger of the king of Elam did bring letters but did not come into my presence; I did not see him and nobody opened his letter before he went back. On the second day of Ab (V), his messenger came to me on the border. I turned him back and sent my messenger to the palace.
My lord should know that my heart is completely devoted to my lord's house.

When we heard that the king was angry with our lord, we became afraid, saying: " Our lord has committed no crime in the king's eyes," inasmuch as he prays every morning and evening to Šamaš and Bel for the life of the king, his lord; his heart is completely devoted to the king, his lord; they are lying about the king, his lord; and they ... his house because he grasps the feet of the king, his lord.
Your father, who was more attentive and circumspect than all (other) kings, used to speak like this: " I want for nothing in the land of Akkad and all the lands." Whether or not Na'id-Marduk was in his mind, the king should not now say: " Na'id-Marduk is (just) one man." He is a hundred thousand troops.
May we, his troops, not slip from the hands of the king, our lord, and may we not look for another lord! May the king, our lord, write to us, and may the king, our lord, ... to Na'id-Marduk, our lord.

Aššur-ereš and Bel-iddin, servants of Urda-Gula, uttered an appeal to the king concerning Ašaredu, commandant of Cutha. When the king, my lord, heard it, he brought him in. But nobody has settled his case with them.
If it is agreeable to the king, my lord, and the king, my lord, commands that he should be tried, then let him be tried in the presence of the chariot driver, the governor of the city of HAR, and the mayor Sasiya, men who are loyal to the king, my lord, before he distributes bribes and gifts concerning them, the men die, and the king's case is hushed.

Hinnumu of Uruk is gaining in everything that we ... not .... It should be known to the king, my lord, (that) his accomplice, Ša-Nabû-šû, is publicly speaking as follows in the presence of Babylonians and Urukians: " The king has written to Hinnumu, saying: ' Fear not! The commandership of Uruk belongs to you. I shall not give it to anybody else in my entourage, and I shall place in your hands all those who plotted against you.'"
Also, he has said to Ahhešaya, the son of Nanaya-uṣalli: " Everything that the king is speaking to you and the Urukians is but a big lie. The chief eunuch comes daily into the presence of Hinnumu. As for you, do not grasp the feet of the king, (as) the king will not do anything for you, but grasp the feet of Hinnumu and stay alive ...! The cohort commander Nuriya and the chief eunuch, Aššur-naṣir, ... have told me: ' You can rely on us.'"
When I heard this talk, I (immediately) wrote to the king, my lord. Ahhešaya ... (and) the scribe of Hinnumu should together be tried in the king's presence.
I am Bel-ušezib, your servant, your dog, and one who reveres you. Let ... to Ahhešaya! This (kind of) talk is not (on behalf) of the king, my lord. Nobody knows anything of what he is thinking up in his mind. The lady Ta... and NN do not know what is in his heart. Whether he will do good or bad ... is known (only) to him in his heart. Nobody says a word .......
Now, if Hinnumu should give ...... and ... intercede for him in the palace, let it be known to the king, my lord, (that) the crimes of Hinnumu against the king are many. He spoke disloyally to the king, your father, (while) he wrote ...... to the king of Elam. Did he not write him as follows:
" I will at my own expense ....... May your messenger come and ...! If you ..., you will not defeat ... and not ......; you will retreat ..., (and) afterwards ...... will destroy my people."
The messenger of the king of Elam led him away ....... He gave the king of Elam a chariot and horses ...... and 20 minas of gold from the temple of .... And he wrote to the king of Elam:
" They have given to you ....... The governor ....... May the king appoint me in his service and ...!"
When ... went with him to Elam, he ...... used to move about in Elam as he wished. Afterwards they did not denigrate him ... to the king, your father. When he departed, ....
Afterwards the king, your father, said to him: " You (dare to) give ten chariots and horses to the king of Elam!" Hinnumu said: " I was taken prisoner and handed over to the king of Elam."
An Urukian, Bulluṭu, son of Hummuru, testified against him in the presence of the king, your father, and they were sentenced to an ordeal. Bulluṭu was saying: " You gave ten chariots and horses to the king of Elam. The Urukians did not hand you over." When they went to the ordeal, Bulluṭu came through clear, but Hinnumu refused it. The king, your father, wrote to him later on and told him: " You yourself ......

Hahhuru, Šelebu's son, the ... of my fathers, kept telling me: " The king's attention is upon me, petition him!"
(So) I went and petitioned the king. For these twelve years I have been in the service of Lubulliṭ, the king's prefect, (while) Hahhuru's men in Babylon have been denigrating my father's house, saying: " His son went into the presence of the king of Aššur."

I arrested the man, handed him over to NN, and told him: " This man should be locked up. I have a case with him before the king." (But) they received three minas of silver from him and released him.
Perhaps the king, my lord, will say: " Who released him?" Those who smoothed the way of Immâ son of Paharu (and) Nabû-ahhe-bulliṭ son of Ubaru, (and) let go by twenty-five jars of wine, one talent and thirty minas of blue-purple wool, (and) half a talent of ... wool.

Also, he should ... send a royal eunuch and put him in charge of the quay .... The king should not neglect it.
The king will say: " A quay — whatever ... this quay?" It is of Calah. Inasmuch as a royal eunuch is put in charge of the quay, the king will be happy and I shall have faith in my life.
... of Belšunu, ...

Concerning the Tabalean at the city wall, may my lord settle his case. He stole things and sold them to Babylon. When your servant heard of it, he impaled the Gurumeans who were with him. He, however, ran away and entered Babylon.
Another time, when Aššur-belu-taqqin was invading the region enclosed by the river, as soon as he heard of it, he went and organised a fight before Aššur-belu-taqqin. As soon as Aššur-belu-taqqin heard of it, he sent a warrant about him, but did not catch him.
Until the death of Aššur-belu-taqqin, he did not enter the Gurumu (territory). But now, he has destroyed the entire house of your servant.
Let my lord remove whatever people are there, and let the others hear of it and be scared. My lord knows that they are ...; there is a curse in their house. They have ' eaten' me ...; who ... could question him? ...

If the moon becomes visible on the 1st day: reliable speech, the land will become happy.
When I wrote to the king, saying, " Cancer stands in the halo of the moon," ... did not deliver my letter to the king, but they took it, eras ed the omen without ..., and concealed from the king the portent that had come.
The great gods who dwell in heaven and earth have suddenly repent ed, and their mind with regard to Nippur and Babylon has changed. The lord of kings knows that I am more devoted to Babylon than to Nippur. How could I change anything that the gods have decreed?
Nippur is a dynastic house and a temple of the great gods of heaven and earth. It is not summoned for state service and it does not pay tribute. They do only the king's work that the king can legally claim, (and) do not ... corv>e therein. It is ... the eternal city of Enlil, the lord of all lands, the organiser of heaven and earth. ..., no malicious finger is pointed at it. And the king who rules over it, should recognise its privileges, so his days will be long.
Now I, your servant, shall ... everything. I shall go to Nippur. If the lord of kings rebuilds Babylon, the land of Akkad in its entirety (and) the citizens of Babylon should reciprocate, so that the name of the king, my lord, will be mentioned graciously forever.
Nippur, like Babylon, is a destroyed sanctuary, and its repair work has not been ordered. Now let the servants of the king rebuild Nippur on their own.
You are a strong, able and righteous king. May the lord of kings attend to Nippur in the same way as to Babylon. The well-known tablet, ' If a king does not heed justice' ... says: " Be it a king, a šandabakku, an overseer, or an administrator, who puts state service on Sippar, Nippur and Babylon, and imposes corv>e on the houses of the gods, these great gods will become angry and not enter their chapels." It will happen. The king, my lord, should inquire (about it) and let them bring the tablet and read it in the king's presence.
The ... who said to the king, my lord, " The Nippurians and the Sipparians are ...; the king should not accept ... because of (them)" — all the inhabitants of the land of Akkad ... Babylon. Now, let the house of the great gods in Nippur be rebuilt by the command of the king.
Perhaps the king will say: " Have they started a lawsuit against somebody?" By Bel, Nabû, (and) the gods of the king ..., I sent these words to the king, my lord, only today. May the lord of kings do as he deems best, and may Enlil, Šamaš and Marduk, the great gods, and the gods of Nippur and Babylon lengthen the days of the king, my lord.
I am Bel-ušezib, your servant and one who reveres you. May I see light under the aegis of the king, my lord.

The word of the king to the non-Babylonians. I am well.
It is said in a popular proverb: " The potter's dog, having entered the kiln, will bark at the potter."
Now you have godlessly made yourselves into citizens of Babylon, and have raised against my servants all kinds of claims that you and your lord have been making up.
In yet another popular proverb it is said: " The words of a sinful woman have more weight at the door of the judge's house than her husband's."
I am herewith sending back to you, with its seals intact, your completely pointless letter that you sent to me. Perhaps you will say: " Why did he return it to us?"
When the citizens of Babylon, who are my servants and love me, wrote to me, I opened (their letter) and read it. Now, would it be good (that) I should accept and read (a letter) from the hand of criminals who ... the god?

The village manager of ... with a couple of king's men helped NN and Hallu su, (two) servants of Nabû-kenu-uṣur, governor of Tillê, to run away, and took them to Upumu.
After I had asked around and investigated a bit, a tracker guided me (on their tracks). I arrested the person who had arranged his trip to Šubria and gave the tracker a messenger, saying: " Go and have a look, and I'll report to the king accordingly; in negative case, I'll search for him here."
The Šubrian (king) concealed him from the tracker, saying: " There is nobody in my presence. A servant of Nabû-kenu-uṣur passed by, and I am supporting the man’s work, (as) he said: ' You gave me a mule.'"
The Šubrian refuses to give away the village manager and those whom he helped to run away. The Šubrian is a friend of theirs.
I am sending him (= the tracker) to the king, my lord. The king, my lord, may ask him. I sent him as soon as he had come back.

The king's word to the governor (of Calah):

Ahu-iddina from Singara, a servant of the chief cupbearer.
In all six criminals, they have terrorized the town of Nashur-Bel.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nergal-uballiṭ. Good health to the king, my lord!
Concerning what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " All the fields of the province of Urzuhina are abandoned. You are taking the fields of Bel-aplu-iddina away (from him)."
What is the field of Bel-aplu-iddina about which he has said to the king, my lord, that it has been taken?
For ten years the king, my lord, appointed the governorship of Urzuhina to me. (During this time) I have never seen Bel-aplu-iddina putting his feet in that field.
The king, my lord, knows that the lands of the vizier's and the chief judge's households do not cross the Radanu river. The royal road which goes to Azari is their border.
When the king transferred me to Que, they removed the local people (and) their fields were abandoned .... The servants of Bel-aplu-iddina, their guarantor, are not obliged to perform state or military service.
They disobeyed our orders, crossed the border and seized a village there.
Now when the king, my lord, sent me to (catch) the criminals; I went there, raised my eyes and saw the village. 2-3 elders of the country, local people, servants of the king, were present in my audience, so I asked them: " Where is the man who gave it (= the field) to Bel-aplu-iddina?
Our servants, the elders of the country, said: " They removed our brothers (and) their field was abandoned. Down came the (men) of Bel-aplu-iddina and seized the village there by force."
Now let 2-3 elders of the country, local people, come and settle (the issue) whose field it is with the servants of Bel-aplu-iddina in the presence of the king, my lord.
They are making unsubstantiated allegations in the king my lord’s presence. If a field in the province of Urzuhina is abandoned is it without an owner? Can anyone who desires a field parcel it out?
Tomorrow the king, my lord, will again hear (many things), but my servants have verily not parceled out (anything).
Perhaps Bel-aplu-iddina, who has ...... in it, will answer to the king, my lord, saying: " Should I sell my fields for money?
Isn't it so that – 19,000 (hectares of) arable land in the province of Urzuhina - about which the king, my lord, said: " It is a reserve. Keep it (as it is) until I take it into use."
To the king, my lord: your servant Ašipâ. Good health to the king, my lord!

Now then let all the Sidonites who came with him immediately come to me with the delegate, and I shall assign the tribute and send it to the king.
The delegate says: " When I heard this matter I wrote to the king that ...... with the tribute ......

He said: " If the Urarṭian either sends troops or comes (himself), I shall go and fight against them."

As to the chief cupbearer, to whom the Šubrian had written: " Send 300 Itu'eans!", the chief cupbearer wrote to me ...: " The Šubrian has written that I should send him 300 Itu'eans."
I wrote to the chief cupbearer as follows: " Write to the Šubrian like this: " Instead of requesting Itu’eans from me, send (them) to me, and (then) I will come."
Perhaps the king, my lord, will say: " Is there any enemy?" There is no enemy at all.
The king has much delayed answering me. Let me come to the king, my lord, and see the king, my lord!
If I do not come (back) here, (already) in the night of the next day the king's people will challenge me, (so) let me come and see the king, my lord.

To the king, my lord: your servant Bel-duri.
The king, my lord, gave orders: " All governors may raise food and fodder from Šamaš-ahu-iddina with you, and Adad-issiya (and) Bel-lešir are to support Abi-lešir!"
They have not agreed to this though, but are disobedient, saying: " Why should our villages in the desert belong to all the governors? The villages are ... within each other!"
The king, my lord, should sent word that they are to write down their desert villages. Ever since the king my lord has levied pack animals from Hamath, I have been on my own, and he (= Abi-lešir) and they (= Adad-issiya and Bel-lešir) have been on their own. Tomorrow the king my lord will surely kill me, saying: " You are but a bunch of do-nothings!"
The following is (my) bread and fodder per calendar month: 105 homers of fodder, 123 homers of bread, total 228 homers, Šamaš-ahu-iddina; 75 homers of fodder, 15 homers of bread, total 90 homers, Abi-lešir; 600 (homers of bread) of 2,000 full-time (lit. ‘free') (soldiers of the king) of Commagene.

he refuses to come. His messengers (are going) to Mukin-zeri and the messengers of Mukin-zeri are going to him. A letter of Zakir was brought to Merodach-baladan with the following message: " Who do you think you are among the chieftains of Chaldea who are left for you? Why do you remain inactive (while) the Chaldean land is getting paralyzed? Is it pleasing to you that Balassu is giving Chaldea to destruction?"
They intercepted the letter which was brought to Merodach-baladan and read it in our presence. But Balassu got very scared, saying: " You must come this moment and deport me! I will go with you. How can I become an enemy of my sister's son? Mukin-zeri is dragging the army here and will destroy the land."
From here, the chief of the Malilatu has come to me, saying: " How can I stay watchful? Cross over and conquer the ...!"
Perhaps the king, my lord, will say: " Do not cross (the river). The king, my lord, knows that the trees are (already) cut.

We went to Babylon on the 28th. We stood in front of the Marduk gate and spoke with the Babylonian(s).
Zasinnu, a servant of Mukin-zeri and some Chaldeans with him came out and stood with the Babylonians before the city-gate. We spoke to the Babylonians as follows: " The king has sent us to you, saying: ' Let me speak with the Babylonians through your mouths. I shall establish the amnesty of Babylon and your privileged status and shall come to Babylon.'"
We spoke many words with them, but some 10 powerful men refuse to come out and speak with us; they keep sending (messages) to us. We told them: “Open the city-gate, so we can enter Babylon.” They refused, saying: " If we let you enter Babylon, what can I say to the king, when the king himself comes?" They will open the gate (only) when the king comes, and they do not believe that the king will come.
We spoke to them like this: " Let Ahu-... and the servants of Mukin-zeri be entrusted to you until the king comes, we shall return to Kar-Nergal."
In this manner we have been speaking with the Babylonians. We shall send any news of them and a white donkey to the king, our lord.
The Litamaeans have written to us, saying: " We are the king's servants. We shall come on the 30th to speak with you, and our leaders will go to the king." As soon as they come, we will bring them before the king, my lord.
The report on Dilbat is still the same. (Apropos) what the king, my lord, wrote, Mukin-zeri ......

Now the sheikhs are coming; let the king, my lord, ask them!
Remanni-Issar came up and met us along the stretch that leads to Kar-Aššur.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " Feed the 6,000 captives in your presence."
For how long? (They are) 6,000! Can I cut out one-third with all the magnates?
Did I not write to the king, my lord, last year: " There is no barley."
The king, my lord, told me: " If you had appealed to me, I would have given you 40,000 (homers) of barley."
Now does the king know that I have no barley? How long still? Let 6,000-3,000 (homers) be given to me, and let 3,000 (homers) also be given to Šamaš-bunaya. This (is what) I am herewith appealing for to the king, my lord.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: " I am giving them (= the other magnates) the later captives." Let them share these (6,000 captives) with me, and I will (then) share the later (captives) with them.
Perhaps the king, my lord, will say: " How are they to enter into the presence of Šamaš-bunaya? When are they to be stocked?" There are 150 walled towns of Šamaš-bunaya in Arrapha. Let them be brought in there.

The king installed Ilu-mušezib, a baker of Bel-emuranni, in Hatarikka. When the king passed by, Kubaba-ereš a (member) of his community and the (members) of the community of his relatives made him run away. They should make inquiries and return the man to me.
When there was an epidemic here, Ilu-bi'di a cohort commander under my jurisdiction killed a horse. I made up for the horse in his stead and he promised: " I'll give you money."

The messengers of Urarṭu came with them, brought them into the house of Yata', his (= the Šubrian king's) village manager, and gave them bread and water in ... until they returned and went up to Urarṭu.
Your servant Parni-aldê is plotting.

The governor with his magnates has made a sworn deal with the servants of Aššur-belu-uṣur, and they are plotting to kill me. The king, my lord, should know this.

I have appealed to the king, my lord, saying: " Nobody listens to me." If there is a fault of mine before the king, my lord, let the king, my lord, kill me but why are these (people) killing me?
The king, my lord, gave me the order: " Receive regular horses and give them to Dadî! Also receive the king’s horse!"
The city-lord of Kišesim brought the tribute and the recruitment officers were in my presence. (As) he was about to enter, I sent my ' third man' to him, saying: ‘Come, stay with me, and let’s go and receive the tribute!"
I (also) said: " (Tell me) if I should come to you and stay (there, so) we would receive the tribute (together)."
He wrote to me: " (As for) you, receive the king's tribute! I shall collect and receive regular (horses) for profit."
Now his son ...
...... why
...... big
...... difficult for him
He collects what he has heard of, (while) they carry him on litters. He sends his lads before me, but they do not receive the regular (horses) nor the king’s horse. He gives orders to the city-lords, saying: ‘Brace (your) heart, do not fall!"
I wrote to him that the chief of tribute should come that I can ask (him). But he responded: " He is not your servant. Why should he come to you?"
Now, he has been prompt to write to the king, my lord, and slander me.
Ever after I went where the king sent me to, I have done my work.
We shall come to the king my lord’s presence, and I and he shall litigate before the king, my lord.
Because of the excellent enemy horses that I receive, he has been hostile with me, like an enemy. Because of envy, he has been prompt to slander me.
He brings the enemy horses to the king, my lord, but receives the regular (ones) as well as the king’s (horses) in the trade colony, and (only then) brings them to the king, my lord.

The king gave me the order: " Honour him!" By my god, I do respect him greatly!

Concerning the Tyrean (king) about whom the king said: " Speak kindly with him!"
All the ports of trade have been released to him; his servants go in and out of the trading posts and sell and buy as they wish. Mount Lebanon is at his disposal, and they go up and down as they wish and bring down the wood.
I collect a tax from anyone who brings down wood, and I have appointed tax-collectors over the ports of trade of the entire Mount Lebanon. They are keeping watch over the mountain.
The Sidonites chased away the tax-collector whom I appointed to the ports of trade that had been added to me in Sidon. Subsequently, I sent the Itu'eans into Mount Lebanon, and they frightened the people.
Later on they (= the Sidonites) wrote to me, took the tax-collector and brought him into Sidon. I said to them as follows: " Bring down the wood, do your work there but do not sell it to the Egyptians or to the Philistines. Otherwise I do not let you go up to the mountain."
Concerning the people of Kašpuna about whom the king said: " What have you given them for their safety?"
Even before they wrote to me from the Palace, I had already started the work and performed it; afterwards, they sent me a sealed document. (Even if) it had not come to me, yet I had raised (my) hands as for erecting towers but I did not construct the city-gate of the inner quarters. (But after receiving the sealed document) I immediately dropped (everything), took over their king's men and they came with me. I appointed a eunuch over them as fort commander and made 30 Ši'anean men to enter there. They will keep the watch, and release them thus by 30 men.
As to what the king ordered: " Bring 10 Yasubaean households into Kašpuna!"
The water is strong there; the people will become ill. As soon as they will be settled with their water in Immiu, I will bring them with (their) rations into Kašpuna.

Yasubaya went and told them (my message) but they refused to come out.
Yasubaya came back and told me their news, saying: " They say: ‘If the troops really come, we will see them and we will come out from there; otherwise if the troops do not come, we will certainly not come out. We will stay in the town until we will see the troops.'"

The king's word to Aššur-šarru-uṣur: I am well, Assyria is well: you can be glad.
As what you wrote to me: " A messenger of Midas the Phrygian has come to me, bringing me 14 men of Que whom Urik had sent to Urarṭu as an embassy" – this is extremely good! My gods Aššur, Šamaš, Bel (and) Nabû have now taken action, and without a battle or anything, the Phrygian has given us his word and become our ally!
As to what you wrote: " I shall not send my messenger to the Phrygian without the permission of the king, my lord" – I am now writing to (tell) you that your messenger should not be cut off from the Phrygian's presence. Write to him in friendly terms and constantly listen to the news about him, until I have more time.
As to what you wrote: " Should I send his subjects to him just as he sent me the subjects of the king my lord?" – send them to him that he will be favourably disposed towards us. Whether 100 of his men or 10, write to him like this: " I wrote to the king my lord about the men of Que whom you sent to me, and he was extremely pleased; and in return ... he wrote to me as follows: ‘Do not hold back even a single one of the Phrygians at your court, but send them to Midas immediately!' Thus at the king my lord's behest I am (now) sending you these men."
As to what you wrote: " A messenger of Urpala'a came to me for an audience with the Phrygian messenger" – let him come, and let Aššur, Šamaš, Bel and Nabû command that all these kings should wipe your sandals with their beards!
As to what you wrote: " Kilar has requested from me four districts, saying: ‘Let them give them to me"' – should you give these four districts to Kilar, would he not become your equal, and what would you yourself be ruling over as governor then? Tell him as follows: " Earlier, you were afraid of the Phrygian, but now the Phrygian has made peace with us, so what are you afraid of? Now eat your bread and drink your water under the protection of the king, my lord, and be happy. Do not worry about the Phrygian."
As to what you wrote: " Urpala'a may slip away from the king, my lord, on account of the fact that Atunnaeans and Istuandaeans came and took the cities of Bit-Paruta away from him ..."- now that the Phrygian has made peace with us and ..., what can all the kings of Tabal do henceworth? You will press them from this side and the Phrygian from that side so that (in no time) you will ‘snap your belt' on them. Thanks to my gods Aššur, Šamaš, Bel and Nabû, this land has now been trodden under your feet! Move about as you please, do whatever you have to do, cut the long and lengthen the short until I come and give you ... work!
As to Balasu concerning whom you wrote, I have heard his words in full. The day you see this letter, appoint his son in his place over his men. His people should be assembled and present, and if he wants, he may take them over the mountains and settle them there, or they may also live here. As for him, let one of your ‘third men' pick him up posthaste and let him come here. I will speak kindly with him and encourage him, and in due course I will send word and have his people (being kept) here returned, and he too can go and re-enter his house.
As for Aplayu, let your messenger bring him and his people to me, whether (they are) citizens of Babylon, Borsippa, Kish, Nippur, Uruk, Der, or (...)
